The allure of South Korean dramas is changing, and for the better.</span></p><p><span>Several plays today feature strong female characters, either as protagonists with significant screentime and character development or as supporting characters completely independent and brimming with knowledge.</span></p><p><span>While female characters were often marginalized and added as a token representing a decade ago, K-dramas have transformed the narrative in recent years. They now emphasize strong, courageous, and empowered women who add to the drama.</span></p><p><span>(Please remember that the author’s opinions are reflected in this article.)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/unnamed-1.jpg><h2>Consider the following five female K-drama characters who outperform their male counterparts</h2><h2>1. Fight for My Way – Choi Ae-ra (Park Ji-won)</h2><p><span>Park Ji-won Choi Ae-ra is a formidable opponent. Despite her difficulties, the ambitious yet grounded department store employee never loses sight of her goals and continues to work for them. She takes her aspirations, independence, and love for friends so seriously that she never allows them to overshadow her happiness.</span></p><p><span>Choi Ae-charms RA’s are a mix of charming and lethal. In one scene, she pretends to be a naive woman who doesn’t know how to box and ends up punching the man in the face. She is very considerate and encouraging to other ladies.</span></p><h2>2. Do Ha-na (Kim Se-Jeong) and Choo Mae-ok (Yeom Hae-ran) – The Uncanny Counterpart</h2><p><span>Do Ha-na and Choo Mae-ok, Counters of the Uncanny Counter (a group of humans with talents tasked with sending evil spirits back to the dead), stand out exceptionally well. The combination is difficult to beat since they always care for the issue better than the others.</span></p><p><span>Kim Se-Jeong plays Ha-na, the sole survivor of her family’s poisoning, who becomes a Counter and never backs down from a confrontation. She is mature, intelligent, and, contrary to the stereotype of women who allow their emotions to get in the way of their work, she uses her feelings and experiences to help others.</span></p><p><span>Yeon Hae-ran portrays Choo Mae-ok, a bereaved mother who has lost her son. She redirects her feelings into being the Counter team’s cornerstone. Her knowledge and compassionate demeanor distinguish her as one of the top female K-drama heroines.</span></p><p><span>Mae-ok, as the leader, always saves the day with her healing abilities and swift solutions.</span></p><h2>3. Ji Sun-woo (Kim Hee-ae) Married People’s World</h2><p><span>The World of the Married is the highest-rated drama in Korean television history for a reason, most of which is due to Kim Hee-Ji ae’s Sun-woo.</span></p><p><span>Sun-woo is a devoted mother and wife in the K-drama who sacrifices her happiness for the sake of her family and work. But she seizes control of the relationship when she discovers that her perfect family is flawed when she uncovers her husband cheating in front of her while her friends assist him in doing so.</span></p><p><span>Sun-woo gets a divorce and vows vengeance with the world against her. With her passionate passion for wrecking their lives running high, she shines as the sharpest person in K-drama. Sun-woo defies the norm of women wallowing in self-pity when they discover they’ve been cheated on.</span></p><p><span>Han So-hee, who played the second wife, rose to prominence due to the show. As a result, the actress was cast in some shows.</span></p><h2>4. Ko Moon-young (Seo Ye-Ji) – It’s Okay to Be Uncomfortable</h2><p>Ko Moon-young yells, “I told you I love you,” in the middle of the road as the protagonist passes a famous moment for K-drama lovers. That doesn’t stop her from falling in love or caring for the people she cares about. In It’s Okay to Not Be Okay, Ko Moon-young was portrayed as having an antisocial personality disorder.</p><p><span>Moon-young, a true tsundere, appears cold and sassy but takes a stand in difficult situations regardless of the repercussions. Her ferocious demeanor reflects her concern about having someone to love and protect.</span></p><p><span>She never changes for the male protagonist, and she doesn’t expect him to shift his focus away from his autistic sibling and toward her. She assumes equal responsibility and expects to be recognized.</span></p><h2>5. Hong Cha-young (Jeon Yeo-been)</h2><p>K-drama Vincenzo Vincenzo and Jeon Yeo-been are a perfect combination. Hong Cha-young is a clever, committed lawyer who knows her letters’ laws. She is full of energy, ambition, and determination.</p><p><span>She juggles being an elegant lady who outwits the old ups and an exuberant, lively woman who knows when to let her hair down.</span></p><p><span>Cha-young becomes a close ally of the leader, and the two work together to bring down the corrupt Babel Group. She is never pushed to the sidelines; instead, she is always in the spotlight, going to people and putting her vast expertise and knowledge to good use.</span></p><p><span>Bonus: I’m Soo-Jung as Bae Ta-mi, Lee Da-hee as Cha Hyeon, and Jeon Hye-jin as Song Ga-kyeong. They are the three primary and empowering leads in the K-drama Search WWW. The show depicts what goes on in the lives of career-oriented women: they don’t back down. They don’t sacrifice their jobs for love, and they don’t discount themselves for love and much more.</span></p><p><span>As the women hold top positions at competing companies, the show is packed with powerful and inspirational messages. It also lacks the classic catfights and focused ladies who encourage one another.</span></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGhsZqukp7yvs4yfnKaZnJp6rHnDq5immV2YtaK%2BwJyrnqqjYsSpu4yuq62doqHGbrDOpqCnmaSasW7Ax55krKCfrHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
