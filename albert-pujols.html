He was the only child in his family.</span></p><p>Albert’s parents divorced when he was three years old. After that,&nbsp; his father took custody of him. He did, however, maintain cordial relations with his mother and stepfather.</p><p>Albert’s father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a notable softball pitcher in the Dominican Republic. However, his divorce and retirement from his career had a huge toll on him. As a result, he became an alcoholic.</p><p>Albert, who was ten at the time, had to bring his father home from drinking every night with his friends. He had a difficult time because of his father’s drinking.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The baseball prodigy mostly grew up with his grandmother, uncles, and aunts. His father didn’t care about him. Instead, he used to take care of his father.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But, Albert never hated his father and his upbringing. Instead, he idolizes his father and says he matured early due to his father.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Later in 1996, Pujol’s family moved to Washington Heights in New York for better opportunities. But, Albert was almost killed in the shoot-out that happened in the city.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The bullets whizzed past him, and he had a close call to death. After the shoot-out, the family moved to Missouri.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Albert grew up in Missouri and enrolled in Fort Osage High School there. He graduated from high school in December 1998.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Then, he studied at Maple Woods Community College, where he was given a baseball scholarship.</span></p><h2>Albert Pujols | Baseball Career</h2><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How did he start Baseball?</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Albert Pujols credits his father for his inspiration in baseball. Albert got familiar with baseball since his father was a baseball player and would take him to his games.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Watching his father play the games, he realized that he wanted to be like his father; he wanted to be a baseball player.</span></p><p>The baseball prodigy used to play baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove. Albert played in the streets with fellow neighbor kids.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When he was 12, Albert joined a youth baseball team where he competed in local competitions.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But, he couldn’t pursue a baseball career in the Dominican Republic since his family soon moved out to the USA.</span></p><h3>Lost and Found Through Baseball</h3><p>Albert had difficulty adjusting to the USA as<span data-preserver-spaces=true> he didn’t know English. In addition, it was a new place and culture that he wasn’t familiar with.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition, his classes were taught in English, but he only spoke Spanish. Due to the language barrier, Albert couldn’t make friends who would guide him.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, he was lost in this new country and had no idea what to do there.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But, he found one thing familiar there, and it was baseball. So, he enrolled in the baseball team and soon became a baseball star in high school.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He was named an All-state athlete twice and even received a Baseball scholarship at Maple Community College.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/albert-pujols-high-school.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When at Maple Community College, he had a sensational debut game.
