To this day, the letter still makes its way around the internet as what many consider as, one of the most romantic love letters.</p><p>“My mouth hasn’t shut up about you since you kissed it. The idea that you may kiss it again is stuck in my brain, which hasn’t stopped thinking about you since, well, before any kiss.”</p><h2>Alexa Chung and Alex Turner&nbsp;Split</h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>Alexa Chung and Alex Turner started dating in 2007.

They reported,</p><p>“Alexa and Alex both wanted things to work. It was best that they both got out now and saved their friendship.”</p><p>Chung’s spokeswoman, Liz Matthews, also confirmed Turner and his girlfriend’s split. “It’s completely amicable—but yes, it’s true.
