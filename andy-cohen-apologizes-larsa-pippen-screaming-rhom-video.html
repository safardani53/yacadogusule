During the taping of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives of Miami</a>&nbsp;Season 5 reunion, Bravo host&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>, 54, posted a video of him saying sorry to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Larsa Pippen</strong></a>, 48, on Jan. 26. “We’re still shooting, and I didn’t have screaming at Larsa on my bingo card today,” he said via his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram Story</a>. Immediately, the 48-year-old could be heard asking if Andy was going to apologize. “Are you going to apologize?”, she asked, to which the host replied, “I’m sorry Larsa.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>After he said he was sorry, someone off-camera asked why he was apologizing. “For screaming at her,” he began. “I don’t like screaming at women. I said it on the break, I don’t want to scream at women. Anyway, sorry.” After a fan re-posted the video to Instagram, many of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the show’s</a> viewers took to the comments to react to Andy’s post. “I’m glad that Andy yelled at Larsa she be too full of herself sometimes,” one fan wrote, while another added, “I don’t like Larsa but Andy is a little too comfortable screaming at women.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Amid the apology, many of the fans also reacted to the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seating arrangement</a> at the reunion. “The #<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>RHOM</a> Reunion seating chart is here! <strong>Nicole [Martin]</strong>&nbsp;first chair! Kiki at reunion!”, the fan account captioned <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the photo</a>. While they looked at the seating chart, one fan noted their opinion on who deserved to be closest to Andy. “Nicole and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lisa</strong> [<strong>Hochstein</strong>]</a> deserved those first seats,” they penned, while another added, “I’m here for Nicole’s seat!!” Despite this, some were not pleased to see&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Guerdy Abraira</a>&nbsp;</strong>sitting at the end of everyone else. “Justice for guerdy!!!”, the separate admirer wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/andy-cohen-larsa-pippin-apology-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Prior to the bit of drama with Andy and Lisa, the 54-year-old took to his Instagram Story on Thursday to show off his reunion outfit. For the day of filming Andy rocked a dapper navy <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>blue suit</a> complete with a white button-up and black tie. “Good day for a reunion! #RHOM”, he captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mirror selfie</a>. In the fan re-post, many reacted to Andy’s post with compliments on the show. “Best cast ever !!!!!!! Best show on Peacock,” one fan wrote, while another said, “Don’t want <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>this season</a> to end.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The&nbsp;RHOM&nbsp;has been on since 2011 and currently stars Lisa, Larsa, Guerdy, <strong>Alexia Nepola</strong>, Dr. Nicole Martin and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Julia Lemigova</strong></a>. <strong>Marysol Patton</strong> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Adriana de Moura</strong></a> also joined the show as “friends of the cast”, per&nbsp;US Weekly. Following the taping of the reunion, it was also reported that Larsa had unfollowed Nicole and Adriana, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Housewives Room</a>.
