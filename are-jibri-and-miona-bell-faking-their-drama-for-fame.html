It seems to change pretty dramatically)</p><p>First things first: Season 9, Episode 13.</p><p>Jibri and Miona’s moments of the episode began with Jibri very conspicuously saging the house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Sage has enjoyed multiple spiritual, medicinal, and culinary uses across millennia and continents.</p><p>In Jibri’s case, he was clearly attempting to purge negative energies from the home and bring good vibes.</p><p>His reason was simple: Miona was about to have a very serious talk with his mother, one-on-one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>See, Jibri and Miona have been facing multiple conflicts over wedding planning — among other things.</p><p>Miona wants her beach wedding. Jibri wants something more practical and close by.</p><p>The wedding date is so close that it’s baffling that they are still going back and forth, but at least they compromised.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Miona at down with Mahala to break the news.</p><p>She shared that she and Jibri are planning to elope — with a destination unknown, but possibly Joshua Tree.</p><p>That way, Miona can have her picture-perfect wedding photos now, and they can have a big, family wedding in a year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Mahala and her husband, Brian, were invited … but it sort of didn’t matter.</p><p>As diplomatically as she could, Mahala explained that the last-minute plans for an out-of-state wedding mean that she can’t go.</p><p>Simply put, if Jibri and Miona had planned this out months ago, things would be very different.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Miona returned to Jibri to tell him how the conversation went.</p><p>In her estimation, it went very well.</p><p>This was not, however, how Mahala saw it, and she relayed her impressions to Brian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Simply put, this last-minute schedule change is exactly what they expected from this “clusterf–k” of a relationship.</p><p>It’s a mess. Jibri and Miona are a mess.</p><p>As Mahala said, they choose difficult paths for themselves … but this is also making life difficult for those around them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Also, this “compromise” just sounded to Mahala and Brian like Jibri giving Miona what she wanted at all costs.</p><p>Miona thinks that he listens too much to his parents. They think that he listens too much to her. Maybe they’re all right.</p><p>But … maybe they’re all making a big fuss out of a moot topic. Are Jibri and Miona already married?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jibri lived in Serbia for a time, which is how he met Miona.</p><p>In an interview, he referred to Miona as his wife — well, allegedly.</p><p>See, he has claimed that this was a translation error. “Fiancee” can be tricky in translations, to be fair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Even if they married in Serbia, we don’t know the details of their visa filing in the US — maybe that’s not as fake as it seems.</p><p>However, we think that what has fans so suspicious is simple: these two seem like the types to get on TV for fame.</p><p>Jibri has his band. Miona clearly wants to be an influencer. They might do anything for exposure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Are they faking drama to grow their brands? Is Daveed in on it? Is his family in on it?</p><p>It is always possible. With some couples, more “fakery” comes from some of the cast than from production meddling.</p><p>But Jibri and Miona seem more than capable of having this much drama without meaning to.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WEcK3RnmSjoZKntm6tzZ1kpqGfo65ursSlo2aekaC2r7OMrZ%2BeoaJisbOtzJpkn6eiYrOiucRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
