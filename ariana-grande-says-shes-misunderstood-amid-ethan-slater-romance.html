The “Thank U, Next” hitmaker called this year one of the “most transformative” years and also seemingly slammed rumors surrounding <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her romance</a> with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ethan Slater</strong></a>, 31. “One of the most transformative, most challenging, and yet happiest and most special years of my life,” she began in the statement. “There were so many beautiful and yet polarized feelings.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The hitmaker also expressed how she has grown in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her career</a>. “I’ve never felt more at the mercy of and in acceptance of what life was screaming to teach me. I’ve never felt more fulfilled by or present in my work, being able to cherish every moment,” Ariana added in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the note</a>. “I gave everything I could have possibly given of my heart and of myself to the projects I was fortunate enough to be a part of and learned so much from every brilliant, beautiful, soul that I had the privilege of creating art with and crossing paths with this year.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ariana Grande via Instagram stories 🥹</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>‘i have never felt more pride or joy or love while simultaneously feeling so deeply misunderstood by people who don't know me, who piece whispers together and make what they want out of me and their assumptions of my life’ <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/BDhGLc3URf</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— Ariana Grande Stats 💋 (@AriGrandeStats) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 29, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>This year, Ari worked on the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Wicked&nbsp;films</a> alongside her boyfriend and her new bestie,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cynthia Erivo</strong></a>.

It’s a very normal relationship.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Before being linked to Ariana, Ethan was married to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lilly Jay</strong></a>, whom he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed to divorce</a> in July.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5FyZpqqmZa7onnGq5innJViwKLF0maqoZ2jYrqqv9Snm56qo6m8sLCMmqSinF2awamtzWaqpZmkmr9uvs6mmKeblWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
