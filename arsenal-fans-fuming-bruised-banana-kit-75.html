Ffs @Arsenal @adidasfootball, why you pricing fans out of this iconic shirt."</p><p>Another said: "Charging 75 quid for the bruised banana shirt considering our situation is mad. A lot of people probably won’t be able to afford that this close to Christmas, weird move."</p><p>A third quipped: "Arsenal dropping a £75 shirt the day after they win their first game in two months is such a own goal, I wonder if the Conservatives are in charge of their PR.</p><p>While another tweeted: "£75 for the shirt!!
