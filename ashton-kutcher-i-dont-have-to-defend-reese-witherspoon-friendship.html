She texted me and Reese together. She’s like, ‘Guys, you gotta, like, act like you each other.’ And I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ Here’s the thing: If I put my arm around her and was, like, all friendly with her, <a href=#>I’d be having an affair with her</a> — the rumor would be that I’m having an affair with her,” Kutcher said in a clip from his upcoming Wednesday, February 8, appearance on the <a href=#>“Chicks in the Office” podcast.</a> “If I stand next to her, I put my hands in my pockets so there’s no chance that, like, that could be the rumor — <a href=#>the rumor is we don’t like each other</a>. Reese and I are really good friends. We’re really close. I don’t have to defend that. I don’t have to defend it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ashton-Kutcher-Says-He-Doesnt-Have-to-Defend-Friendship-With-Reese-Witherspoon-After-Viral-Red-Carpet-Pics-3.jpg><p>Kutcher and Witherspoon, 46, made waves on social media for seemingly keeping a distance at a photo call over the weekend.</p><p>“I can’t hear very well. I’m hard of hearing in one ear and I can only hear in the other,” the That ‘70s Show alum continued. “I don’t know who’s yelling my name, but I know there’s a lot of people yelling, ‘Reese! Ashton! Over here! Look at this one! Over here!’ At a certain point you’re looking you’re like, ‘God, this is really something. OK, which one? Look at the camera. Got it. OK, are we done? Awesome.’ For, like, 20 minutes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ashton-Kutcher-Says-He-Doesnt-Have-to-Defend-Friendship-With-Reese-Witherspoon-After-Viral-Red-Carpet-Pics.jpg><p>Kutcher concluded: “If you’re gonna tell me in that entire 20-minute period, at one point, you’re not going to have an awkward face, then you’re better than I am. And I’m cool with that.”</p><p>Witherspoon, for her part, <a href=#>spoke about Kunis’ reaction to the pics on Monday, February 6.</a></p><p>“She even emailed us last night. She goes, ‘You guys look so awkward on the red carpet together,’” the Legally Blonde star said on Today With Hoda & Jenna on Monday. “He’s so professional. He’s the funniest guy. I mean, such a goofball. We had so much fun, and every time he’d wear a funny outfit, I’d text Mila. I’d be like, ‘What is he wearing?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ashton-Kutcher-Says-He-Doesnt-Have-to-Defend-Friendship-With-Reese-Witherspoon-After-Viral-Red-Carpet-Pics-2.jpg><p>The actress referred to Kunis as a “girlfriend” who she’s “loved for so long.” Witherspoon subsequently had to “learn to be friends” with Kutcher on the set of the rom-com.</p><p>“I was like, ‘These are my dogs. These are my kids.’ My kids would tease him about his football team,” she explained.</p><p>Witherspoon shares daughter Ava, 23, and son Deacon, 19, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Ryan Phillippe</strong> </a>and son Tennessee, 10, with husband <a href=#><strong>Jim Toth.</strong></a> Kutcher and Kunis, meanwhile, <a href=#>wed in 2015</a> and are the parents of daughter Wyatt, 8, and son Dimitri, 6.</p><p>“Honestly, I think I had more fun shooting this movie than I ever had,” Kutcher gushed to Variety earlier this month. “It was genuinely a choice. I didn’t need to do it. I didn’t have to do it. It wasn’t like a career-building block. It was like, ‘I want to do this.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He went on to call Witherspoon a “genuine movie star.”</p><p>“She’s such a movie star. It was so wonderful and fun and funny and light,” Kutcher said. “There was never a dark day. There was never a day that everything went wrong. I got spoiled.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaq5ipvK95yq6rnKCVp3qqecOopa1lmJbDpnnTqGSdnZaau6V50Z6crJ1drLa1tMSrqqmnn6N6p77InqWdq5ievXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
