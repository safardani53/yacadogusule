Which should come as a surprise to no one who's seen the show and knows how misogynist and sexist the industry is.</p><p>See, for example, any time the female deckhands get asked to work on the interior, or every single time the crew address the captain simply as "Sandy," which would never fly with Captain Lee. But breaking the glass ceiling of yachting isn't the only thing Captain Sandy has accomplished in her 30 years of experience.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She's also beat cancer and a life-threatening motorcycle incident, not to mention the time she was chased by pirates in the Red Sea. How is she so resilient and how does she manage to keep her cool?&nbsp;</p><p>"I choose not to come from a place of power and control and it really, really works," she says.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I like to empower my crew to be the best they can be ... I lead by showing the crew what I expect, not telling them what to do," she continued in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo</a>. "When I am pushed, I don't push back, I navigate."</p><p>Captain Sandy has also had to navigate the waters of having her relationship made public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Captain Sandy married?</h2><p>It wasn't too long ago that Captain Sandy was looking for love in Los Angeles, where she lived before relocating to Denver "for love."&nbsp;</p><p>"It's hard to have a relationship being a yacht captain," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo</a> in May 2018. "I want someone who wakes up happy, just is happy to be alive."</p><p>"Someone who wants to live, wants to experience, wants to travel, wants to try different restaurants, wants to go see shows," she continued. "And I love music. Someone who loves concerts because I am a concertgoer."</p><p>We're delighted her wishes were answered. Captain Sandy just announced her relationship with gospel singer Leah Shafer in 2019, and while they haven't tied the knot yet, the two gorgeous ladies are still wildly in love.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The couple met in November and struck up a conversation on Facebook. "She sent me a nice message that said, ‘I came across your show, congratulations, many blessings,'” Captain Sandy told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>. Captain Sandy learned that Leah was a gospel singer and says that she knew she was The One the minute they met.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Leah, who's the mother of a 14-year-old daughter, added, “It just happened, when you meet another soul that you connect with at such a deep level; it is unexplainable and so beautiful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's Captain Sandy's net worth and how can you follow her on social media?</h2><p>If you're a fan of the show, you know that the crew bring in some hefty tips after each charter season. The tips are often in the tens of thousands of dollars, or euros, in the cast of Below Deck Med.&nbsp;</p><p>But that's just chump's change compared to what the yacht captains bring in. Yacht captains have to clear a security and background check in addition to having an MMC (Merchant Marine Credential). According Cheat Sheet, Captain Sandy makes anywhere between $120,000 and $210,000 a year.</p><p>Don't miss Below Deck, Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo and follow Captain Sandy on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and on Twitter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7Ktu9Zmm56bm2K6prCMnJiprJGeu26%2FwKebsmWXnr%2BtstGinKec</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
