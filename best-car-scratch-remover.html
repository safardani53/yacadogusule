Autoglym Scratch Removal Complete Kit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/glym.jpg><ul><li><strong>Autoglym Scratch Removal Complete Kit, £18 from Halfords - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Car care favourite, Autoglym, has put together this kit that takes you right through the scratch repair process from start to finish.</p><p>It’s a bit pricey, but contains everything you’ll need.</p><p>The waffle applicator pad not only works the product into the paintwork, but has been effective at reducing hand cramp that often accompanies repairs like scratches.</p><p>Though the applicator pad can be tough to get into places like door handles, repeated detailing in these areas will reduce the appearance of scratches.</p><p>Buff the excess product and Super Resin Polish for a high-gloss finish all over the car.</p><h2>2. T-Cut Scratch Remover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/T-Cut-Scratch-Remover-e1561117524475.jpg><ul><li><strong>T-Cut Scratch Remover,</strong> <strong>£8 from DIY.com- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>“Enhanced by nanotechnology” is another way of saying that science has enabled T-Cut’s boffins to refine the molecular structure of its scratch remover.</p><p>This means its particles are even more effective at gently removing blemishes without damaging the surrounding area of the paintwork.</p><p>If it goes beyond the clear coats of lacquer, T-Cut’s range of colour choice will help hide the damage and enhance the car’s existing colour.</p><p>It won’t be perfect, since that can only be achieved with a respray.</p><p>However, for this price, it’ll be marginally less conspicuous.</p><h2>3. Meguiar's M205 Mirror Glaze Ultra Finishing Polish - 8 oz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MEGUIARS-M205-Mirror-Glaze-Ultra-Finishing-Polish-8-oz..jpg><ul><li><strong>Meguiar's M205 mirror glaze ultra finishing polish - 8 oz, £20.49 from Amazon- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Like many of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">car polishes on this list</a>, Meguiar’s Mirror Glaze is a fine-textured formula for removing debris off the paintwork.</p><p>If you’ve only got white hair-like scratches, you’ll be left with a beautifully smooth surface, which you can buff to a high shine.</p><p>However, if the scratch goes through to the colour, primer or metal of the car, Mirror Glaze won’t be sufficient to repair it since it’s designed to smooth scuffs and minor scratches from the clear lacquered layers of the paintwork, rather than the lower layers.</p><h2>4. Auto Care Repair Paste 250g</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/autocare-e1558515789173.jpg><ul><li><strong>Auto Care Repair Paste, £6.25 from Wilko- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Auto Care Repair Paste is worth a mention for those looking to fill in deeper scratches.</p><p>A little bit like Polyfilla, Auto Care Repair Paste fills the gap, if the scratch is significantly more severe, or has turned into a hole.</p><p>An involved effort is required as you’ll need to colour match your paintwork.</p><p>However, the paste is worth a try if the scratch isn’t in an obvious place and you have a gentle hand when it comes to touching up paint.</p><h2>5. Farecla G3 Professional Scratch Remover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/G3-Pro-7164-500ml-G3-Pro-fessional-Scratch-Remover-Liquid.jpg><ul><li><strong>Farecla G3 Professional scratch remover liquid, £9.25 from Amazon- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Farecla is another brand that has been in the laboratory enhancing its formula.<br>Using a blend of what Farecla calls ‘Engineered Diminishing Abrasives’, the idea is the particles reduce until the scratch remover turns into a smooth wax polishing fluid.</p><p>Best applied with the waffle applicators Autoglym also recommend, Amazon does a deal, charging £17.24 for both the remover and pads (and in the process, making Autoglym’s kit look like a bargain).</p><p>That said, users report fantastic results, especially when tackling remnant bird poo marks other products won’t shift.</p><p>The pros love it and the results speak for themselves.</p><h2>6. Quixx Paint Scratch Remover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Quixx-Scratch-Remover.jpg><ul><li><strong>Quixx paint scratch remover, £8.98 from Amazon- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Quixx is a great product for those with a careful disposition, steady hand and bags of patience.</p><p>Quixx Paint Scratch Remover is better at tackling deeper scratches, but if the scratch goes to the primer, you’ll first need to apply a colour correcter and then use this Quixx kit.</p><p>Complete with sandpaper to get a smoother finish, the gentlest of efforts will take out scratches and then help blend the damaged lacquer.</p><p>A solid buff will mitigate any hazing or dullness, for an almost flawless finish, but we can’t emphasise the effort and patience needed enough.</p><p>Still, far cheaper than a garage repair.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More from sun selects motoring</h2></p><p>If you're planning on giving your car a bit of love, check out our selection of the best <a href=#>car wax</a>, <a href=#>pressure washers</a>, and<a href=#> car polish</a>.</p><p>Looking for more motoring recommendations?
