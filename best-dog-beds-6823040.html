Not only does it provide a warm, comfortable and safe spot for them, it can also be very useful during training, serving as a specific space that they can retreat to, she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our team (and their dogs) evaluated 20 of the top-rated dog beds on the market in every size and style we could find. The dogs used them for two weeks while their parents evaluated the beds’ quality, how comfortable they seemed, the size, ease of cleaning, and value. According to both the dog and human testers, 10 dog beds earned winning spots, offering a little something for everyone (well, every dog).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for the best dog beds, according to PEOPLE.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-furhaven-memory-foam-plush-and-suede-sofa></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Furhaven Memory Foam Plush and Suede Sofa</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Furhaven Memory Foam Plush and Suede Sofa" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JNSx22eMHUpTMw6dKk2kHY0lxic=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/furhaven-orthopedic-cooling-gel-and-memory-foam-pet-beds-for-small-medium-and-large-dogs-and-cats---plush-and-suede-sofa-quilted-sofa-comfy-couch-dog-bed-and-more-cb2cf6e0919d4c6ea44e45831291c4e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Versatile design options, including a memory foam and cooling gel foam</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Spacious enough for a 75-pound golden retriever (and kept him cool)</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Holds up well after washing</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This bolster-style dog bed proved to be both extra comfortable and nice and spacious for our team member’s 75 pound dog, George. So much so that it pulled in a perfect five out of five in every category. We found the bed to be immensely soft, not just on the surface, but in its cushioning too. Our tester even curled up in their dog’s bed to get a firsthand feel. Their dog is partial to a human bed, but he did sleep on the dog bed regularly during the daytime and in the evenings. The dog really seemed to like resting his head on the bolsters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also like that it came in a cooling gel foam option, which kept long-haired George from getting too hot, a turn-off for him when it comes to many other beds. The quality and ease of cleaning were also excellent (the cover easily zips off and holds up well, even after being washed), as was the overall value. Our tester has tried several similarly-priced beds, but they were all much lower in value, and with five sizes (we tested the jumbo) and 15 colors to choose from, there’s a little something for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>5 | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, memory foam |&nbsp; <strong>Colors: </strong>15 | <strong>Machine Washable: </strong>Yes, the cover is</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-midwest-home-quiet-time-ombre-swirl-dog-crate-mat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MidWest Home Quiet Time Dog Crate Mat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Midwest-home-quiet-time-ombre-swirl-dog-crate-mat style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/VW_N8a26pJ-OBNMjrC7ojneXqm4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/midwest-home-quiet-time-ombre-swirl-dog-crate-mat-7f26e96fe2f349388b1c9ef9755f189b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Adds a plush cushioning to your dog’s crate for a more cozy experience</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Easily machine washable and still looks brand new after laundering</p></li><li readability=0><p>The lowest-priced bed on our list, while still offering a great value</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Excellent and accurate sizing options</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>It’s only available in three neutral colors, so if you prefer something more whimsical, check out our other picks</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re in the market for a dog bed, but want to stick to a more conservative budget, we’d suggest the MidWest Homes crate bed. Our tester appreciated the soft and plush feel of the bed, which almost acts like a mattress you can place in your dog’s crate. Our tester joked that their dog is a bit high maintenance and only spent a little time on the bed at first, but started spending much more time on it once her favorite blankets were added to the equation. (We all like what’s familiar, right?) Overall, the bed is a solid baseline option to add a little cushioning to a crate.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of quality and durability, the bed performed really well. The tester’s dog likes to eat peanut butter kongs in her crate, and naturally some of that mess got on the bed. Our tester was able to wash and dry the cushion on regular cycles and it came out of the laundry looking brand new. The sizing was accurate and the bed fit the dog perfectly when she was lying down as well as the dimensions of the crate. If you crate your dog frequently throughout the day, this bed can add a little coziness to that environment. Plus, it’s portable and makes a great backseat bed for road trips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>7 | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Machine Washable:</strong> Yes</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4032 data-sizes=750px alt="A dog lays on in the MidWest Homes for Pets QuietTime Crate Bed." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/h06fWwTyUcdzGJdqjXlNsf2Naq0=/fit-in/1500x4032/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/midwest-homes-pets-quiet-time-crate-bed-genevieve-roublick-02-6101e2a4586749d58598b2f2b8e4589e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>People / Genevieve Roublick</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3024 data-sizes=750px alt="A dog walks halfway into a crate with the MidWest Homes for Pets QuietTime Crate Bed inside." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/UfuGJ-7QaOuS1s5KmdzLyl7OaB4=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/midwest-homes-pets-quiet-time-crate-bed-genevieve-roublick-09-45ec69d62635459fa3a24f4edeff43be.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>People / Genevieve Roublick</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-calming-best-friends-by-sheri-calming-donut-bed-in-lux-fur></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Calming</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Friends by Sheri Calming Donut Bed in Lux Fur</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Best Friends by Sheri Calming Donut Bed in Lux Fur" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/9153O4_N71q4cD5CViPV61x6ry8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Best-Friends-by-Sheri-Calming-Donut-Bed-in-Lux-Fur-30977b77da654ddba1b999223e8cfe5d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chewy</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Donut shape provides a comforting edge to sleep against and allows for burrowing behavior</p></li><li readability=1><p>The cover is easy to wash and dry (and after hand-washing, you can use a low setting to tumble dry the insert too)</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s available in almost any color to match your decor scheme</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have an anxious pooch or just a puppy in need of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>calming dog bed</a>, this popular donut-style model has a good reputation for a reason. Dogs love it. During our real world tests, our tester said both of their dogs loved the bed — with the elderly dog frequently burrowing into the plushy bed, while the young puppy enjoyed flinging it around (or attempting to).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It held up well after laundry day, and we were delighted that we could put it in the dryer. It came out spotless and didn’t need much reshaping. Overall, the quality is sound, and dogs instantly gravitate towards it due to the furry texture. The donut shape is especially appealing to anxious dogs who like a barrier at their backs or those who like to burrow in their beds for comfort.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">PEOPLE senior commerce writer Madison Yauger has had the Best Friends donut bed for about eight months and her dog is a big fan. “My rescue pup has a lot of anxiety and she always looks so peaceful when nestled into this bed,” Yauger says. “Especially when she had her spay surgery and couldn’t get on the furniture, this bed provided her a peaceful place to rest and heal. It has survived lots of playtime between her and other dogs, as well as a few accidents. It washes easily and looks as good as new, every time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>6 | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyfill and long-shag fur | <strong>Colors:</strong> 15 | <strong>Machine Washable:</strong> Remove the fill, then you can wash and dry the cover</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Katie Tuttle</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cooling-amazon-basics-cooling-elevated-pet-bed></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cooling</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amazon Basics Cooling Elevated Pet Bed</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Basics Cooling Elevated Pet Bed" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/se4vOwX_KNQBGTjR4YFcf1eVIDU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-basics-cooling-elevated-pet-bed-0038acd3c8c6484a85581e98d346a157.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Spacious enough for a 75-pound golden retriever</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Has durable and breathable mesh to keep your dog cool and last a while</p></li><li readability=-1><p>On the lower price range of those on our list<br></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have a long-haired dog (hello golden retrievers!) or perhaps a flat-nosed pup (like a pug or french bulldog), chances are they overheat… a lot. A quality <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dog cooling bed</a> allows them to catch some z’s while maintaining a cool body temperature for the best sleep. While a cooling dog bed should never be the only thing keeping your dog cool (sometimes it's just too hot outside for your animal), our tester's dog loved lounging on this bed on warm days. The plastic mesh material on this bed is comfortable but still breathable: It’s a raised bed which might take some getting used to for dogs who aren’t familiar with this kind of structure, but it shouldn’t take long.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our real world tester was a 75-pound golden retriever named George (he’s featured in our lovely lead image at the top of this story). He took to this bed immediately, bringing an assortment of his toys to chew on while he sprawled on this bed outside on the porch. He seems comfortable and cool when laying on it (no excessive panting or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>other signs of discomfort</a>). The mesh material hasn’t seen any rips and tears, and it’s easy to wash down with a damp cloth or even hose off. The large size fits George well, and he has plenty of space to stretch out. We wish it was a little more portable (it’s challenging to dismantle for travel), but otherwise it’s a comfortable and cool spot for your dog to relax, and it's sure to last for a long time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>5 | <strong>Material:</strong> Mesh | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Machine Washable:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-orthopedic-furhaven-ultra-plush-luxe-lounger-orthopedic-dog-bed></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Orthopedic</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FurHaven Ultra Plush Luxe Lounger Orthopedic</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="A dog laying down on the FurHaven Pet Orthopedic Ultra Plush Lounger" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/QHfw9QG9dWz4_yDki35PCoaq1Ts=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/furhaven-pet-orthopedic-ultra-plush-lounger-32b015d63d8f4c38901b77eed46aed7d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3><li readability=1><p>&nbsp;Supportive for your dog’s back, neck, and head (especially with the slanted ends)</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Spacious enough for a 53-pound dog to stretch out comfortably</p></li><li readability=0><p>Lightweight material, and easy to wash the cover in the laundry machine</p></li><li readability=0><p>Available in 11 colors, so it can go with almost any design scheme</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For older dogs or those with joint issues, an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>orthopedic dog bed</a> can be a great solution. During our real world tests, the 53-pound dog who tried this bed loved it. The foam was supportive but still soft to lay on, and the sloped sides of the bed offered a pillow-like cushion. The size allowed her to fully spread out — she’s a big stretcher in between naps, and the foam supported her while still letting her body sink in a bit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The cover is a sherpa-type material that’s easy to clean because you can throw the cover in the wash. We also appreciated how lightweight the bed was — it’s not bulky and you can easily throw it in the car. It’s a great bed, especially for larger dogs, and provides good support for the head, neck, and back. Our tester’s dog constantly slept on this bed and always seemed to have had a restful sleep.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>6 | <strong>Material:</strong> Orthopedic foam | <strong>Colors:</strong> 11 | <strong>Machine Washable:</strong> Cover is</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Ellie Storck</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-burrowers-furhaven-snuggery-burrow-dog-bed></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Burrowers</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Furhaven Snuggery Burrow Bed</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Furhaven-snuggery-burrow-dog-bed style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/lX79zOEeKslV7Hv27RVQEgwumGY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/furhaven-snuggery-burrow-dog-bed-36edcea97d1949fe802368882aff984b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Furhaven</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=3><p>This comes in several different styles, including a memory foam, cooling gel foam, and even orthopedic foam</p></li><li><p>Extremely durable</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Holds up well after washing</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some dogs like to bury their faces and in some cases, their whole bodies, into their beds. The Furhaven Burrow Blanket facilitates that and more, because it offers a cushioned place to rest with a sheltered covering. “If your dog likes to burrow under the covers a cave bed can provide them with the same feeling, without messing up your bed,” says Dr. Bernal. This was the winning pick for those types of pups, including our tester’s 25 pound Frenchton. The tester’s dog usually makes little cries when she can’t bundle in blankets to her liking, yet with this bed she immediately falls asleep.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are several options of the base to choose from, including memory, cooling gel, and orthopedic foam, the latter a nice choice for older dogs. Our tester gave it a five in the size category, noting that it fit their small dog perfectly, though if you have a larger dog keep in mind that the largest size is only intended for dogs up to 80 pounds. The removable cover was easy to machine wash and keep clean, and while it did earn a slight deduction for value (with our tester noting that the faux sherpa and suede materials weren’t particularly thick), at its current price, it would be worth replacing every few years, if needed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>6 | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, memory foam&nbsp; | <strong>Colors: </strong>11 | <strong>Machine Washable: </strong>Yes, the cover is</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-design-tuft--needle-dog-bed></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Design</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tuft & Needle Dog Bed</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Tuft--needle-dog-bed style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Z0e2G3Ry_jVMTK5tMPyi7cxoXrg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tuft--needle-dog-bed-9b1583749e79458ba7fc9caed7f3b2e9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Aesthetically-pleasing design</p></li><li readability=1><p>The quality and construction of this bed is very high-end, using many of the same materials the brand uses in their human beds</p></li><li readability=0><p>A detachable mat can be taken off the base and used elsewhere, such as in a dog’s crate</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester raved about both the impressive quality of this bed, as well as its chic design. They said the overall design showed a lot of consideration, especially what materials were used. This earned it a five out of five for quality. There was also a detachable mat, which pops off the base and can be used elsewhere if you like. To that point, this bed is made of a foam that’s very similar to that that the brand uses for its human mattresses. And even though it can cost up to $270 for the large size, our tester still found it to be a fairly good value, given the thoughtful design and&nbsp; materials.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It would be a good choice for those who wanted to spend a bit more on a dog bed. Where this didn’t perform quite as well was comfort. The material is almost like a canvas and not as soft, which is great for durability, but not so much for comfort. The insert fill was quite plush and comfortable, but the outer material outweighs the comfort of the interior — and it took some coercion to get the dog on the bed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>3 | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane foam (base); polyester fiber-fill (pillow); cotton-polyester blend (cover)&nbsp; | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Machine Washable: </strong>Base and pad covers can be washed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-durable-carhartt-durable-canvas-dog-bed></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Most Durable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Carhartt Durable Canvas Dog Bed</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Carhartt Durable Canvas Dog Bed" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/vWb_kjyyHvuSAzzP-Y7xEEaHMwQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/carhartt-firm-duck-dog-bed-durable-canvas-pet-bed-97d61bc34ce94076ac7e8c3118e6e9fc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester had their 45-pound puppy Dasie put this bed through the ringer and it held up beautifully. It proved extremely durable due to the hefty material that held up despite stains, digging claws, and lots of chewing. (Dasie would occasionally pee on the bed, and it would wipe right off instead of seeping into the bed.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The duck canvas cover is machine washable, though our tester noted that washing and drying it was a bit time-consuming and didn’t yield much more of a difference than spot cleaning. Their pup loved to curl up on the bed, thanks to the padding for long naps.

The tester’s dog loved snoozing on the bed whether inside or outside, and that’s in part to the soft material yet durable material.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even though it’s extremely lightweight (again, a great choice when you’re camping or backpacking), it was still super warm and retained the dog’s body heat when zipped up. The pup used it both zipped and unzipped; the latter made for a nice supplement to function as a blanket for an indoor dog bed. It didn’t score quite as well in the size category; it was a bit smaller than expected, though still fit our tester’s 55 pound pup well. However, our tester did note that it would be good to size up. Even though it’s on the pricier side, it still scored a five in the value category, with the quality materials and multi-use options earning rave reviews.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>2 | <strong>Material: </strong>Synthetic down | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Machine Washable: </strong>Yes, but air dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-k9-ballistics-tough-rip-stop-rectangle-pillow-dog-bed></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>K9 Ballistics Tough Rip-Stop Dog Bed</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="K9 Ballistics Tough Rip-Stop Rectangle Pillow Dog Bed" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SuCQG5lB1s1IqYQfbZXsRjqE668=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/k9-ballistics-tough-rectangle-pillow-medium-dog-bed-1bcc1842d7374c8dac38bb9faccb0d8c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Size</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=1><p>The cover is waterproof, dig-proof, and machine washable</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The bed itself is the perfect mix of both soft and sturdy</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this option is among the most expensive dog beds on our list, our tester deemed it totally investment-worthy for its comfort, quality, and ease of cleaning.

The tester’s dog loves bully sticks and bones filled with peanut butter, but they’re so messy. When the pup would eat on top of the bed, it created a visible mess with residue, but it came off with a cleaning spray and paper towel. The cover is also machine-washable, and entirely waterproof. Our tester was quick to note that it would be a great choice for dogs that aren’t yet potty trained or who slobber a lot. While it could be a bit more aesthetically-pleasing, if you don’t mind a no-frills style, this is an excellent choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>4 | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, shredded foam&nbsp; | <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Machine Washable: </strong>Cover is</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-12 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3024 data-sizes=750px alt="A dog lying on the K9 Ballistics Nesting Dog Bed with their toys." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-wD4W-Q2avCbldlFZuwdDxi6qME=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/k9-ballistic-nesting-dog-bed-alyssa-kingham-06-9d5964f8831046bdbfb45a8ca38b3379.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Alyssa Kingham</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3024 data-sizes=750px alt="The K9 Ballistics Nesting Dog Bed as it comes packaged from the retailer." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/AZZuyNufqelm0TopToMNRKnbmbc=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/k9-ballistic-nesting-dog-bed-alyssa-kingham-01-a23b41d5b8014e84bf5dc146ec6973fe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Alyssa Kingham</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-dog-bed></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Dog Bed</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s important to choose the right size bed, as getting it wrong can make a big difference when it comes to your dog’s warmth and comfort,” says Dr. Bernal. “A bed that’s too small may be cramped and uncomfortable, so if your dog is in-between sizes or still growing, size up.” She suggests measuring your dog from the tip of their nose to their tail in order to get the right fit. “Then measure from their shoulders to the floor. This measurement will tell you how wide the bed should be,” she suggests.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sense of Security</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The bed becomes the dog’s safe space, an area they know is theirs and that they can retreat to for rest and relaxation,” Dr. Bernal explains. "This can be especially important if the dog’s bed is relocated, as they still know the bed is their secure place." To that point, dog beds are very handy for traveling; if you can bring your dog bed along, it provides a familiar place for your dog to settle without the scent of home, adds Dr. Tory Waxman, co-founder and chief veterinary officer of Sundays for Dogs.

(Our favorite orthopedic dog bed pick is this <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Furhaven Dog Bed</a>.) Similarly, beds with adequate amounts of padding are important for large breed dogs, who can scrape their elbows when they rise from hard surfaces, which can lead to scarring and even calluses, adds Dr. Andy Chiang, a veterinarian with RIFRUF. Have a puppy? Make sure your bed is resistant to chewing, digging, and accidents.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Dog’s Preferred Sleeping Position</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>“</strong>The position your dog prefers to sleep in will help determine the shape, filling and kind of bed they’ll like best,” explains Dr. Bernal. She explains that some dogs like to burrow or sleep curled up and in that case a basket bed or one with a bolster of some kind would be good. The raised sides also provide a little headrest for them to prop their head against if they prefer,” she adds. “And if your dog loves sprawling out while they sleep, a cushion, pillow or mattress style bed will be a better match. These types of beds don’t have any raised sides, so they give your dog more freedom to stretch out,” she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Washable covers</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beds with washable covers will make your life infinitely easier, particularly if you have active dogs that like to play (and get dirty) outside, notes Dr. Chiang.

For each test, our real dogs (they’re a picky bunch) tested over 60 dog beds to determine which ranked the best for quality, comfort, size, and durability — and for the cooling test, cooling abilities.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For each test, our dog parents set up the bed, placing any inserts inside covers, and then assessed the overall design. Our team felt the material, and the density of the cushion. For cooling beds, we considered if the beds were actually cool to the touch, and for the orthopedic beds, we looked at how much support the beds provided. We also determined if the beds were too bulky or if they were portable (think backseat size for a road trip), and how accurate the sizing was, both for the dog and where the bed was intended to go (such as the crate bed, and if it actually fit in the crate).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After letting our dogs use (and in some cases, abuse) these beds for two weeks, we assessed the durability. Was sticky peanut butter able to come out of the furry material with just one wash? Was there any sign of wear? How easy were the beds to clean? We looked at all of these qualities and gave each bed a rating on a scale of one to five. Then we chose our dog’s (and our) favorite beds for our list of the best dog beds of 2024.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-137cd551-a4e9-4b68-a96c-69d84ed21009></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Should dog beds be soft or firm?</span></p><p>This depends largely on your pup’s sleeping preferences, as well as their age. However, according to the veterinarians we spoke with, softer beds with lots of cushion or padding are especially important for older dogs or dogs who may have any issues with their joints.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do dog beds need to be machine washable?</span></p><p>It depends, but it does add to the convenience. However, if you are going to machine wash it, Dr. Waxman suggests always using a fragrance-free detergent, given that dogs are very sensitive to smells. If you’re trying to clean up an accident, pre-treating it with a dedicated cleaner beforehand can be helpful, she says.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Should you have a dog bed in every room?</span></p><p><strong>“</strong>While your dog may always have a favorite bed, a good rule of thumb is to provide your dog with one dog bed per room where the family generally spends the most time sitting, sleeping, or relaxing. If you have more than one dog, make sure that each dog has their own bed in these places,” says Dr. Bernal. And that holds particularly true if you don’t allow your dog on furniture, as you still want to make sure they have a comfortable space to relax, adds Dr. Waxman.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Melanie Rud</a> is a freelance beauty writer, editor, and expert living in Chicago.
