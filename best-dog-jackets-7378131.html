As dog parents, we wanted to test real-life considerations, like how easy it is to get the jacket on your dog.

While this dog has worn winter apparel before (and wasn’t a huge fan), she didn’t seem to mind this vest and looked more comfortable while wearing it — she didn’t slide across the wall like she does when wearing her other coat (due to static, itchiness, or other elements of discomfort).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Little Beast vest’s design is quite stylish, with five color options (four of which are reversible), and a well-fitted silhouette that doesn’t restrict movement. It was super simple to put the jacket on Ophelia, and it has a tie on the end to help tighten the fit for a more snug feel. The puffer material is made of 100 percent polyester with a nylon exterior: durable and water-resistant materials that are known to last and will keep your pup warm. It's easy to clean as well. Just be sure to machine wash this vest on a cold, gentle cycle to extend its lifespan (making sure to fasten the velcro closure before washing).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it's on the pricier side, the value is evident with this vest, which mimics human outerwear we would be glad to own ourselves. It’s easy for your dog to wear on walks without restriction or discomfort, and will hold up over time with its durable material and reversible colors for added flair. Ophelia was a big fan, and so are we — especially for a dog that needs an extra winter layer but doesn’t love restrictive clothing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS–XXL | <strong>Material:</strong> Nylon shell, polyester padding | <strong>Style:</strong> Reversible puffer vest | <strong>Colors: </strong>6 |&nbsp; <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-thinkpet-cold-weather-dog-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ThinkPet Cold Weather Dog Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ThinkPet Cold Weather Dog Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tP43nuEhKEYk92JQ5L85pvledNU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/thinkpet-dog-cold-weather-coats-2cacee12be0648d986fdd0038abf0aea.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>There’s a zipper opening to feed harness rings through for dogs that wear harnesses on walks.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The design is super easy to get on and off, even for the squirmiest dogs.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has Velcro closures to keep it securely in place.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved the design of this dog coat and so did our canines. It has velcro around the neck and under the belly which keeps it on securely but is easy to dress your dog in. There’s also a super functional two-way zippered opening for a harness clip. Plus, the soft fleece interior and smooth polyester exterior are reversible, so you can style it whichever way suits your fancy. In terms of fit, our dog is a fluffy boy, and as such, the jacket was a bit tight around his torso so you may want to size up for fluffier dogs. On the other hand, the arm and neck holes were quite spacious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This particular pooch isn’t a huge fan of jackets and often tries to take them off, but this one held him securely with large, strong velcro sections. (Just be sure to check that longer fur doesn’t get caught in the velcro when fitting the jacket on your dog.) We loved the fleece interior, which is sure to keep your dog warm in even the coldest climates, and we also loved how easily it works with a harness underneath. Considering the price, user-friendly and comfortable design, and mobility of this jacket, it’s an easy “add to cart” for us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS–3XL | <strong>Material:</strong> Quilted fleece and polyester | <strong>Style:</strong> Sleeveless jacket | <strong>Colors: </strong>12 | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jake Green</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-puffer-gooby-padded-vest-solid></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Puffer</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gooby Padded Vest</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gooby Padded Vest Solid" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/BJdsuCYsKIGibioG87qtloRRsR8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gooby-padded-vest-solid-8d5cb15bed4846bd9de85b961083cf6b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2.5><li readability=2><p>It has a step-in design, which can be great for older dogs with limited mobility, as well as squirmy dogs.</p></li><li readability=0><p>If your dog dislikes their harness, this jacket can replace it.</p></li><li readability=0><p>There’s a safety lining along the closure to keep your dog’s fur from getting caught in the zipper.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a level of puff that will keep your dog warm in the coldest climates, this padded vest ought to do the trick. It’s so puffy that it actually interfered slightly with our dog’s natural gait; though after a few walks with it, this wasn’t an issue. We were dazzled by how easy it is to put on your dog, considering the unique back-closure design. You just let them step into it (almost like a harness) and then zip it behind their back. And there’s a safety flap to prevent any fur from getting caught in the zipper — a huge bonus for long-haired breeds — and it blocks the zipper from rubbing against your dog’s back while they walk.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The biggest benefit of this padded vest is you can replace your dog’s harness with it during cold months because it comes with two D rings to clip the leash to. And for added warmth, there’s a soft fleece lining that will keep your puppy's belly and entire torso cozy. The exterior is a durable and waterproof nylon that successfully repelled water when we poured water on it to test resistance. Since it’s so easy to put on and doubles as a harness, this puffer vest is a huge timesaver before heading out on a walk. When you consider all the qualities and the decently low price, this dog jacket is a winner.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Material:</strong> Fleece lining, nylon exterior | <strong>Style:</strong> Padded vest | <strong>Colors: </strong>12 | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-vest-kurgo-loft-dog-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Vest</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kurgo Loft Dog Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1125 data-sizes=750px alt="Kurgo Dog Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/rmpPUTeabQNzRjVJVOT3r0AiOsQ=/fit-in/1500x1125/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kurgo-0adc6b44b0114d3b95fb931a25646202.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kurgo</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3><li readability=3><p>It has a water-resistant, ripstop material, so even if your dog chews on it, it won’t be as susceptible to tears.</p></li><li readability=0><p>There’s a zippered opening for harness rings so your dog can comfortably wear one underneath the jacket.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The design doesn’t restrict movement, and the Velcro fasteners are easy to adjust.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A vest is an apparel staple for your pet — it provides an extra layer of warmth on days you’d rather be inside (having spent many a cold morning at the dog park, we know this feeling well). It's made with water-resistant ripstop material, so it's great for walks in the rain and snow. There's also a zippered opening for harness rings, so you can attach it to a jacket on extra-cold days. For the most part, we loved the fit of the Kurgo Loft Jacket and noted that it didn't restrict movement. It uses velcro fasteners, so it’s easy to adjust where needed. The only exception is the neck hole, which doesn’t have much give, so you should be extra mindful when ordering the size.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our dog who tested this vest (a 10-pound Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, for size reference) seemed to like wearing it. She didn’t show any signs of irritation like trying to gnaw, pull, or scratch it. It’s also super easy to put on your dog, and the plush filling provides warmth but isn’t so bulky as to get in the way of their movement when walking or playing outside. Throughout testing this vest, it’s been washed several times via laundry machines and has held up without loose strings, fading color, or other issues. It’s also shown durability on many walks and dog playdates. Considering the price and fun color options, we think this is a great everyday dog jacket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS–L | <strong>Material:</strong> Ripstop material | <strong>Style:</strong> Outdoor vest | <strong>Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hooded-canada-pooch-winter-dog-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Hooded</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Canada Pooch Winter Dog Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Canada Pooch Winter Dog Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/x4PJQNBS1cjXVMvzN9dYzoJjIJM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/canada-pooch-winter-dog-coat-5c835609ae9f490f8ad9f23c9c6a8dda.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>You can comfortably fit a harness underneath it due to the slightly oversized fit of the jacket.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It's made with a cozy and durable material that wicked away water in our tests and during rainy walks.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want your dog to look sleek and sophisticated, this hooded dog jacket might just call your name. It mimics a small parka and comes in green, gray, maroon, and black, with a faux fur hood. (This jacket is made without any animal products: no fur, no down, no leather.) We noticed the jacket was a touch big on our dog, which worked out because we walk him with a harness and there was plenty of room for it underneath —&nbsp;plus a slit to pull the rings through. One hiccup we noticed is there are about 10 inches of velcro that go down the torso section, which makes this jacket quite secure, but it’s also not the easiest to get your dog in and out of.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During walks, our dog didn’t seem to mind the jacket at all, though he pushed the hood back off of his head (we think he might be more amenable to it when it’s raining or snowing). The jacket has a great design with a soft fleece material inside, as well as two pockets on the back of the jacket for anything you might want to carry on your walks. It’s super water-resistant which we tested via pouring water on it as well as taking several walks in the rain. Overall, we think this is a durable and comfortable jacket that will last a long time. Plus, our dog really liked it!

He didn’t seem to mind wearing it at all, and it fit him beautifully (we used the size guide online to select one that would fit). We also appreciated the thoughtful design, with details like fastener buckles underneath flaps to keep them hidden. These also reduce the chance of getting our puppy’s fur stuck in the buckles. Plus, there’s a harness slit so you can clip a leash through the back of the jacket for easy access and elastic leg loops to keep it in place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it is a little pricey, and the jacket doesn’t cover the dog’s head or legs (there’s no hood), it’s super water-resistant and honestly looked adorable when worn by our dog. We would not recommend this for a day spent in the rain since your dog’s head and legs will likely get drenched, but for a little walk in the rain, this jacket is perfect. On our rainy day walks, everywhere the jacket covered our dog was completely dry when we arrived home. In this case, we think the price is worth it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XXS–XL | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Style:</strong> Jacket |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fleece-wagwear-fleece-zippy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Fleece</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wagwear Fleece Zippy</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wagwear Fleece Zippy NEW" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KIP8bUBcX2UC6HWXEYOEL3jC4LI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wagwear-fleece-zippy-0005661ff3b642098541ee3f932c4bf6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wagwear</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your pup could use a fuzzy fleece to get them through the season, this piece from Wagwear is a stylish and easy-to-wear option. In terms of sizing, we loved that it’s super specific with measurements rather than generalized sizing, so it’s made to fit your dog perfectly. It’s not too loose or too snug, and since our dog, a Goldendoodle who doesn’t like wearing jackets, seemed to be fine wearing this one, we’ll count that as a big win.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The design is super user-friendly — easy to get on and off your dog. Our only word of caution is that the zipper is tough to get started, depending on how your dog is sitting while you fasten it. Once the dog shifted a little, we were able to zip up the jacket without issue. In regards to mobility, this jacket didn’t restrict movement on our walks at all. And being fleece, it’s not surprising that it absorbed water during our test rather than repelling it. But for an everyday winter jacket (rainy days aside), this isn’t a huge dealbreaker. The material is malleable, soft, and comfortable for your pet. It was a little pricey, but it has a really fun design, and it even has a side pocket for spare treats, baggies, or whatever else you might want to carry with you on your walks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>8–24 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Fleece | <strong>Style:</strong> Zippered fleece | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> No</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Veronica Vivona</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-dog-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Dog Jacket</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buying apparel for a dog means considering the shape and size of their body and how active they are. Some dog jackets use standard sizes like XS–XL, which is fine if you use the size guides to determine where your dog fits in that range. The only issue with standard sizing is parts of the clothing might fit better than others — as our dog encountered with the neck hole on the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kurgo Loft Jacket</a>. With numeral sizing, you can get a little more precise with measurements and find a better fit, as we found with the excellent fit of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Wagwear Fleece Zippy</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another consideration is whether your pet wears <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a dog harness</a> when walking. A lot of dog jackets are designed with a slit behind the neck area for you to clip the leash to a harness underneath, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">ThinkPet Cold Weather Dog Coat</a>. So, you might want to size up to ensure the jacket and harness fit well together and won’t limit mobility by being too tight.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The material of a dog jacket determines its durability (during playtime, walks, and daily activity), its resistance to rain, and how easily it can be cleaned — all factors that will contribute to longevity. Not to mention, certain fabrics can cause irritation and itchiness and should be avoided for your dog. “If a dog is to wear clothing, I prefer soft cotton fleece that has some stretch to it,” says Dr. Whittenburg. “This fabric is breathable, soft, and allows for more natural movement.” That said, fleece is a super warm material, so it might cause some long-haired dogs to run too hot when wearing it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The only exception to [my suggestion of fleece] would be situations where the dog may get wet, and a waterproof material might be more appropriate,” she adds. Most dog jackets are made from a version of polyester or nylon, both water-resistant materials that are easily washed. And just like for humans, cotton is also a comfortable option for your canine, so the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Canada Pooch Winter Dog Coat</a> could be a good choice. And when it comes to fasteners, Dr. Whittenburg says velcro is “easier and quicker to secure than buckles” and can be especially “helpful, as dogs tend to be squirmy.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fur Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind, some dogs have natural coats built in — and thick ones at that. Dogs with long, thick coats are bred for cold climates, and they don’t need dog jackets (nor will they want to wear them). A few examples might be Siberian Huskies, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Great Pyrenees, etc. Meanwhile, short-haired dogs like Labs, French Bulldogs, Beagles, and Pitbulls might greatly benefit from an extra layer of warmth in the winter. So keep your dog’s fur type in mind when choosing what kind of jacket you purchase. Long-haired dogs like Golden Retrievers might also get their fur stuck in certain zippers or velcro closures, so safety features like what the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Gooby Padded Vest</a> has in place could be useful.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-dog-jackets></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Dog Jackets</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Material and Fit: </strong>We put these dog jackets to the test, deferring to the only critics who matter here: our dogs. Looking at the construction and design of each jacket, we considered if the fasteners were high quality (Velcro, snap, or other) and if the fabric seemed comfortable and durable. Then we put the jackets on our dogs, testing how easy (or difficult, in some cases) it was to dress our furry pals. We looked at the overall fit (too snug, too loose, or just right?), whether our pups seemed comfortable (no signs of itching, chewing on the material, or other irritated behavior), and if the fasteners felt secure when the dog wore the jacket.</li><li><strong>Walk Test: </strong>For good measure, we took the test to the streets, putting on our dogs’ normal collars or harnesses with the jackets on top, and then walking our dogs for at least 15 minutes. Our team considered how the jackets fit when the dog was moving (especially over a harness), and whether the fasteners stayed secure the whole time. We also looked at whether the jackets seemed to keep our dogs warm by looking for any signs of shivering if cold or panting if overheated. Another important factor is if a jacket limits mobility or gets in the way when the dog relieves itself.</li><li><strong>Water Resistance:</strong> Upon return home, we considered the ease of jacket removal, as well as the durability and water resistance of the material. Our team poured water over the jacket to see how the water reacted with the material (whether running off immediately or absorbing into the jacket). We repeated this whole process on six or so walks to get the full picture of each jacket’s functionality.<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-81ba1006-4cbc-4267-9eb0-b0a5995fcc3f></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50.612265585403><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How should a dog coat or jacket fit?</span></p><p>With any type of dog apparel, you want to make sure it doesn’t cut under their legs and restrict movement. It’s also important that it’s comfortable to wear, otherwise, your dog might resort to chewing or gnawing on it. The best way to ensure a good fit is to take your dog’s measurements and then use the sizing guide for that specific jacket to find the right size.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.98504486540379><p><span class=accordion__title>Do dog jackets help with anxiety?</span></p><p>Light compression, similar to the sensation of a hug, is a known calming solution for anxious dogs, which is why you see things like thunder jackets and other vests and apparel designed to help with anxiety. “Some dogs very much enjoy wearing clothes and may absolutely feel comfort when wearing a jacket,” says Dr. Whittenburg. “This is very individual to the particular dog, however.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>Since dogs can’t verbally tell us if something is uncomfortable, Dr. Whittenburg says to look for behavioral signs of discomfort. “Some dogs do not care for wearing clothes and forcing them to do so can cause stress and anxiety,” she says. “Dogs wearing jackets should also be monitored at all times to avoid overheating. Dogs cannot sweat and may overheat more easily than humans.” She also recommends speaking to your veterinarian first if your dog has anxiety because “there are many remedies that will likely be more effective,” such as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>calming dog bed</a>.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Should a harness go over or under a dog jacket?</span></p><p>In almost all cases, the harness should go underneath a dog jacket.
