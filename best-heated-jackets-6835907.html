If your regular winter jacket isn’t cutting it for you in the warmth department, PEOPLE has got you covered with a toasty step up — the heated jacket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Now it’s very mainstream, but ten years ago, when my cousin and I founded The Warming Store, there were very few people who had ever heard about heated clothing, and very few brands,” The Warming Store co-founder Justin Silverman tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Heated jackets were actually invented to keep people warm while riding motorcycles in the cold,” he adds. “The wind chill makes it feel a lot colder commuting to and from work or going on a scenic ride... but I wear my heated jacket primarily while dropping my kids off at school! We have a lot of customers who buy heated jackets for skiing, but most people actually buy them to be more comfortable during daily activities.” In other words, regardless of your situation, if you're in a cold-weather environment and looking to keep extra toasty, these high-tech jackets can be a total game-changer. It's like wrapping yourself up in a cozy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>electric blanket</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">PEOPLE put 17 heated jackets through their paces in order to offer you the best recommendations to stay super warm all winter.

The instructions were straightforward and include pictures‚ plus there’s just one button to press for cycling through heat settings and turning the heat on and off. A dedicated pocket inside the jacket stores the battery and closes with a zipper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We noticed the difference between heat settings, and the highest setting was quite hot. The heat was strongest on our back but we could feel it on our chest as well — making for a cozy experience. Listed as water-resistant, the jacket did repel water nicely, rolling off the sleeve well in our testing. It felt dry inside, though the outer sleeve felt damp after a few minutes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only gripe with the design of this jacket is the LED light being visible from the outside. Personally, we would prefer more discrete heating. The plus side to the outer button is that it's extremely easy to access. The rest of the design was great as well. There are two roomy side pockets and one on the chest, the padded hood is detachable and adjustable, and there is also a cord to tighten the bottom of the jacket. The jacket feels pretty lightweight, and it's nicely tapered at the waist to create a flattering silhouette.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Care instructions: </strong>Machine wash | <strong>Heat time:</strong> Up to 10 working hours | <strong>Heat zones:</strong> 3 | <strong>Hood:</strong> Detachable | <strong>Hem:</strong> Adjustable</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="ORORO Women's Heated Jacket with Battery Pack" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4okW61UIdQrZicja0CQ7E7gHOQE=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-heated-jackets-test-ororo-womens-jthompson-0356-aca2f77f41334fd2a10df42060c50a17.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="ORORO Women's Heated Jacket with Battery Pack" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/MmTP-0aNb4sinW34pa9T6hzhNUk=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-heated-jackets-test-ororo-womens-jthompson-0337-d0df0ead9d8549d995c8985ade77d872.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-venustas-heated-jacket-with-battery-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Most Comfortable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Venustas Heated Jacket with Battery Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Venustas Heated Jacket with Battery Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ARgj6I94uOBKd_jgQSd3EeUMgt0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/venustas-heated-jacket-with-battery-pack-f715f4040dc54d97b7f6ee9f19c15971.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heating</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>This was easily the coziest jacket we tested — we love how comfortable this one feels from hood to hem</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Intuitive to use and stylish to wear</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Soft padding and artificial warmth? Consider this jacket the perfect winter cocoon. It heated up almost instantly for us and got super warm up in the chest and upper back areas — like being inside a toasted marshmallow. If you like a puffer jacket in general, you'll like this style, amped up in coziness with the heating feature.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The instructions are very intuitive — just hold down the button on the chest of the jacket for 3-5 seconds and the heat turns on instantly without any issues. We also appreciated that the jacket automatically lowered the heat setting after we did jumping jacks while wearing it. This is a great feature if you're doing an outdoor activity like skiing and may not be able to adjust the settings while in motion.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The jacket is lightweight, sleek, and does not appear bulky. The battery pack sits in the bottom left side, so if you have your hands in the pockets, you'll feel it, though it's not an inconvenience, nor is it cumbersome.&nbsp;However, the battery did die in our testing before the two-hour mark.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Above all, we loved how cozy and soft this jacket is. The materials have a high-quality feel, though it's not the most water-resistant — when spraying water on the sleeves, we felt the dampness almost instantly. It would be nice if there were an outer shell on top for very cold or wet weather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Nylon | <strong>Care instructions:</strong> Machine wash | <strong>Heat time:</strong> Up to 8 hours | <strong>Heat zones:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-tidewe-heated-jacket-for-men-with-battery-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TideWe Heated Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TideWe Heated Jacket for Men with Battery Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/AxK0-L8VZYeo3VqGKWdzQibT2r0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tidewe-Heated-Jacket-for-Men-with-Battery-Pack-b5f486a1379d49e08b77e4962a94be54.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heating</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Heats up in less than 30 seconds</p></li><li readability=0><p>Waterproof and windproof, it's a great choice for outdoor winter sports</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Battery pack displays the percentage of power remaining</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>It doesn't have the coziest feel</p></li><li readability=0><p>The fit is quite boxy, particularly for women</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The TideWe Heated Jacket is listed as waterproof and windproof and we found it to be an excellent choice for prolonged periods outside in cold and rainy or snowy weather and can function like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ski jacket</a>. The moisture immediately beaded up and rolled off in our testing. The features were quite useful, like a battery pack that displays the percentage of power remaining. This jacket heated up incredibly fast — less than 30 seconds — and we felt the most heat in the back. It also got warmer the longer we wore it. Set-up was relatively easy with just an instruction tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We counted eight pockets total, plus pockets on the sleeve, making this a good choice for skiing or snowshoeing. We found it to be designed more for function — with the variety of pockets and a hood with a hard brim to keep water out of your eyes — versus comfort. It was comfortable enough in our testing, just not the coziest feel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Care instructions:</strong> Machine wash | <strong>Heat time:</strong> Up to 10 hours | <strong>Heat zones:</strong> 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hybrid-tidewe-mens-3-in-1-heated-jacket-with-battery-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Hybrid</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TideWe Men’s 3-in-1 Heated Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TideWe Mens 3-in-1 Heated Jacket with Battery Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/RdJWsK4bfi-QSabFEBI_0B44UG0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/3in1-50856dc2e5ae4fdda9261be460afc4b2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>TideWe</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heating</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>Very comfortable jacket, not too bulky or restrictive</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It gets quite warm but not uncomfortably hot</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Slim battery for a better fit</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Heats up in around a minute</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We didn’t get off to the best start with this jacket, but it ended up being one of our favorites. It took us a second to figure out that the LED heat display was on the under-layer, and we also had a tough time locating the battery button, but after the initial confusion, it was very simple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The jacket felt very warm but not uncomfortable and heated up in about a minute. The outer shell is removable and the jacket underneath is stylish and thin, with a slim battery. It’s got a hood and hand pockets, but no chest pocket, and water beaded well on the exterior in our moisture testing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This was the most comfortable jacket we tried on. It did not feel too bulky or constrictive. It was soft and plush on the inside, and it was flexible with our movement. We would wear it as a regular jacket and then use the heat function when needed. It’s non-bulky, stylish, and versatile.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Care instructions:</strong> Machine wash | <strong>Heating zones:</strong> 3 | <strong>Heating time:</strong> Up to 10 working hours | <strong>Layers:</strong> Windproof shell, insulated inner jacket</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-design-dewbu-heated-jacket-with-12v-battery-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Design</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dewbu Heated Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="DEWBU Heated Jacket with 12V Battery Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/QXkFCfnsOgA8BJzPYORxLfS9i-U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dewbu-heated-jacket-with-12v-battery-pack-ff79a23fa1d140f8b73396cf537f255b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heating</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Sleeves warmed up quickly</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Great style and color selection</p></li><li readability=0><p>Setup was easy and intuitive, and it comes with a QR code and video demonstration</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>With a warm but not hot feel, this may not be the best choice for the coldest days</p></li><li readability=1><p>While it was dry on the inside, the jacket remained wet to the touch on the outside after spraying it</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The arms warmed up the quickest on the DEWBU Heated Jacket, on top of the warming zones on the front and back. It's not necessarily hot, but definitely cozy. Advertised as “windproof and snow-proof” it had mixed reviews in our moisture testing. When sprayed with water, the moisture immediately beaded up on the outside of the jacket but remained wet to the touch on the outside. However, the inside was dry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Setup was easy and intuitive, but the jacket also comes with directions and a QR code for a video demonstration. We loved the burgundy color of the jacket (it comes in several color choices) and features like a tall pocket to fit bulky gloves or a water bottle, plus regular sized hip pockets.

It looks like a short, cute rain parka, and we would definitely wear this just walking around the city — though you might want an actual <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>women's rain jacket</a> for heavier precipitation.

The jacket warmed up pretty quickly at just under 90 seconds. We were by no means cold while wearing this jacket, but the most noticeable heat was concentrated on one spot on our upper back. We also felt some mild heating on our left arm. That one hot spot did a pretty good job of keeping our whole body warm, but we would have liked for it to have been a bit more even.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The heated jacket felt lightweight and moved well, though that the heat button — located in the chest of the jacket — might be hard to access if you’ve got the jacket zipped up to the neck on a cold day. Overall, it was comfortable and cozy and the price is right on the money for what you get. The stitching is a blueish/gray color that we really loved. The pocket zippers are the same color. We thought that added a nice stylish touch to set it apart from your basic black zip-up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester outer | <strong>Care instructions:</strong> Machine wash and dry | <strong>Heat zones:</strong> 3 | <strong>Heating time:</strong> Up to 10-12 hours</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PEOPLE / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hiking-actionheat-5v-battery-heated-work-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Hiking</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ActionHeat Heated Work Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ActionHeat 5V Battery Heated Work Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/pSl_WYCNVOXUXKjngG2ZZkOm1Rk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/khaki-f8e49faac7f443a78d754cdd18fdd7f8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dick's Sporting Goods</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Heating</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Very comfortable and warm, with or without the heat turned on</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Great design and well suited to hiking and long days outdoors</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Jacket heated in two minutes and maintained the heat well</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Not waterproof or water resistant</p></li><li readability=1><p>Upper back heating was more prominent than the front of the jacket, which was slightly uncomfortable</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The design of the jacket was sturdy, and meant for outdoor adventure. We would compare it to a Carhartt jacket. Setup was easy and the jacket warmed up after two minutes and retained heat efficiently. However, the upper back heating was more prominent than the front of the jacket, which made it slightly uncomfortable. There was no auto turnoff setting or a temperature auto shutoff, which might be a useful safety feature for a jacket that heats up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We did love the design on this jacket, which features a power bank placed in the pocket — it does not add any bulk to the jacket.

Our top pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ororo heated jacket</a>, comes with a battery pack and has a dedicated pocket for easy storage.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Number of Heating Elements and Placement<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“On the low end, some jackets only heat on the chest or pockets," explains Silverman. "On the high end, Gerbing motorcycle jackets have seven elements that heat the chest, back, sleeves, and neck collar.” Brandi Sutter, part founder of <span data-tts=true>The Weston Store,</span> agrees. “Having enough heating elements on the jacket will define if it is good quality,” she tells PEOPLE. “We always suggest looking for over four heating elements.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Battery Size and Duration<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most people prefer a smaller, slimmer battery that doesn’t add bulk.

Our team noted how simple (or not) it was to get each jacket up and running. To evaluate each jacket’s heating capability, we wore the jacket for five minutes (without using the heating component). We then used a pronged thermometer to take the temperature inside the torso area of the jacket to gauge the natural body heat inside while wearing it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After, we turned the jacket heating component on to the highest setting and recorded the temperature after 15 minutes, or stopping the stopwatch when it began to get warm. The quality and feel of each jacket was tested via us walking around and performing tasks while wearing them — including jumping jacks. These tests helped determine the comfort level when wearing these jackets, and if we would recommend each jacket for winter sports.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also looked at the features like pockets, zippers, the hood, and anything else to see what the jacket offered beyond its heating capabilities. The jackets were also sprayed with water to test their water resistance, and then for a final assessment, internal temperatures were taken after two hours of leaving the jacket turned on to see the longevity of the heating element. Using these insights, we created our best heated jackets list.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-05618273-3e22-409f-86b9-abcaa0cf5452></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50.675503711559><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Are there safety concerns with heated jackets?</span></p><p>Silverman says there are no risks with wearing a heated jacket. Many people also ask if they can wear their heated jacket in the rain, to which he says, “and that's completely safe as well. Heated jackets by the top brands are now even machine washable (just take the battery out of the pocket).”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.98475222363405><p><span class=accordion__title>Are heated jackets really worth it?</span></p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!” promises Silverman. “Heated jackets allow you to spend more time outdoors in cold weather and help you enjoy that time instead of being freezing cold. Whether it's walking a dog, skiing, sitting at a soccer game, or outdoor dining, it simply makes your experience better by not feeling uncomfortable. Heated jackets are also really great for people who have to be outside for work and can help productivity by reducing the need to take breaks indoors to warm up. Another benefit is that you don't need to wear as many layers and avoid big bulky layers with a heated jacket. The active heating elements allow you to stay warm without all the bulk.” You can feel just as toasty as if you were sitting in front of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>space heater</a>.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long does a heated jacket last?</span></p><p>If it’s high quality, a long time. “We have customers who bought heated jackets 20 years ago that still work,” says Silverman. “Typically, the battery will need to be replaced every few years, but the actual heating systems are extremely durable.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Are heated jackets best suited for winter sports?</span></p><p>While anyone can benefit from staying warmer all winter long, even just pounding the pavement, running errands, or sitting in the stands of a football game, those who enjoy winter sports will want to look for a jacket with adjustable heat settings to account for increased body temperature. Says Sutter, “You may want it on high heat in the beginning and low heat towards the end [of physical movement]."<br></p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rennie Dyball</a>&nbsp;is an award-winning author who began her career at PEOPLE in 2002 as a reporter and remained on staff until 2017; she now regularly freelances for the brand.
