What's important to note, though, is that they may have a slight initial "pinching" feel (though nothing too uncomfortable).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Quantity: </strong>6 (3 pairs) | <strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Retinol, hyaluronic acid |&nbsp;<strong>Skin Types: </strong>All</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-demora-24k-gold-eye-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Value</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Demora 24K Gold Eye Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Demora 24K Gold Eye Mask " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/hrd3Eb0ZG1CiD0Yv-SC6BBC5KoQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/demora-24k-gold-eye-mask-e04e812267af42f0bb08f37d8983c9e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With over 14,000 five-star reviews on Amazon, we were curious about what made these under-eye patches so buzzy. Turns out they visibly help fade discoloration and even reduce puffiness and fine lines.

The most common cause is lack of sleep, but they can also be more prominent because of excessive alcohol consumption, allergies, or just plain old aging. In more frustrating circumstances, under-eye darkness can happen because of genetics, whether that be thin skin that showcases the pooling of blood under the eyes or pigmentation in the under-eye area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One ingredient that works diligently to combat this, though, is vitamin C: “This antioxidant blocks the production of abnormal pigment to brighten the skin,” says Dr. Zeichner.</p><li>These particular vitamin C-infused patches receive rave reviews for their ability to boost the under-eye area as well as offer a tightening effect.

While retinol is the gold standard of anti-aging, it can be irritating at times. Encapsulating keeps the retinol protected and it also reduces the risk of flaking, especially around the eye area.&nbsp;These patches may feel a bit heavy and slide out of place, which some may find annoying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Quantity: </strong>2 (1 pair) or 10 (5 pairs) | <strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Retinol | <strong>Skin Types: </strong>All</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hydration-joanna-vargas-bright-eye-firming-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Hydration</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Joanna Vargas Bright Eye Firming Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Joanna Vargas Bright Eye Firming Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/LTD28vOvnlM7mNhTlmFlx9Tsu98=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/joanna-vargas-bright-eye-firming-mask-782427d7aeda4500877153ddd1f5103c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>DermaStore</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No matter the skin issues, all roads seem to lead back to dryness, which can be the source of lines or "caving." These patches are your best bet against that. Dr. Zeichner tells us that these as one of his favorites. For dry skin or hollowness, he recommends turning to hyaluronic acid.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This super humectant acts like a sponge to grab onto water and pull water into the outer skin layer to hydrate dry cells,” he tells us.&nbsp;“This patch contains concentrated hyaluronic acid to deeply hydrate and firm under-eye skin.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have dry skin under the eyes are are trying to tackle fine lines and hyperpigmentation, these hydrating patches may be right for you.

Instead of being infused with active ingredients like hyaluronic acid or retinol, these just function as a silicone patch. They work to amplify your favorite eye creams or serums by holding the product onto the skin and blocking the product from evaporating. Simply apply a serum or eye cream to the under-eye area and allow it to get tacky. Once it does, place the Dieux Skin patch on top and leave it there for 10 to 20 minutes. Voilà — plumper, smoother skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The differences do not stop there — instead of throwing away these patches after you're finished, rinse the patches to get rid of excess product and then pat dry.

Most patches are made to be worn for 10-20 minutes to allow the ingredients to fully absorb because that is all it takes to get the full benefits. In addition, the under-eye area is extremely sensitive. Leaving a patch on for too long can exacerbate under-eye issues like puffiness and discoloration.
