Even celebrities like to kick back and unwind with some vino—in fact, there are even a surprising number of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrity-owned wine labels</a>, including ones from Julianne Hough, Cameron Diaz, and John Legend. However, if you want to enjoy these great wines to their full potential, it’s important to store them properly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Instability and fluctuations in both temperature and motion can harm your wine, as the expansion and contraction of the liquid in the bottle can create off flavors and aromas,” explains Art Decaro, Director of Training & Cellar Master, CMS II, at Waters Edge Wineries. “Proper humidity also plays a key factor in cork stability.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To preserve the quality of your wine, you may want to invest in a wine fridge — also called a wine cooler — which will maintain a precise temperature and humidity level for long-term wine storage. These appliances come in a wide range of sizes, accommodating anywhere from 10 to 100 (or more) bottles, and there are options available for every budget, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The following are the best wine fridges to add to your home.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-wine-enthusiast-32-bottle-dual-zone-max-compressor-wine-cooler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wine Enthusiast 32-Bottle Dual Zone Wine Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon wine-enthusiast-32-bottle-dual-zone-max-compressor-wine-cooler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/nzxdw686KAR0_v4PaBMZoWtGxlI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wine-enthusiast-32-bottle-dual-zone-max-compressor-wine-cooler-c05ff69d114746a6a96798121312ab1b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of value and performance, it’s hard to beat the Wine Enthusiast MAX Compressor Wine Cooler, a top-recommended option among both professionals and wine enthusiasts. This mid-sized wine fridge can accommodate up to 32 standard-sized bottles of your favorite wine, and its dual-zone design includes a large lower zone for long-term aging, as well as a smaller upper area to chill whites and roses for immediate serving. The digital touchscreen on the front makes it easy to adjust the temperature to your needs, and the unit’s compressor cooling technology is both quiet and efficient.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This wine fridge is known for maintaining an incredibly stable temperature, even if the ambient temperature around it fluctuates. The design is sleek and modern with a full-glass door, making it an attractive addition to any room, and there’s even a special display shelf at the bottom where you can show off your prized bottles. Just keep in mind that this wine fridge is designed to be used as a freestanding model — the brand recommends leaving at least 2 inches of space on each side and 4 inches behind the fridge for proper air circulation and cooling, so it can’t be built into your cabinets or recessed in a wall.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>33.4 x 19.5 x 16.9 inches | <strong>Temperature Range:</strong> 41–64°F | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 32 bottles | <strong>Installation Type:</strong> Freestanding | <strong>Zones: </strong>Dual<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-koolatron-urban-series-6-bottle-wine-cooler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Koolatron Urban Series 6-Bottle Wine Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=koolatron-urban-series-6-bottle-wine-cooler style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3jmoSZ2xaGc7jTBs-lWgZV340ak=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/koolatron-urban-series-6-bottle-wine-cooler-5521c9abbca548d8b732b374ed490e07.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Serious wine drinkers often have a few dozen bottles in reserve at any given time, but if you’re the type of person who only keeps two or three bottles on hand, you can save some money with the budget-friendly Koolatron Urban Series Wine Cooler. This compact model can easily be placed on your kitchen counter or in a discrete corner of your home, and it offers a single temperature zone with room for up to six bottles of wine. (The brand also has a slightly large model that holds 10 bottles if you’re looking for a little more space that's still at an affordable price point.) It’s perfect for storing your budding collection without breaking the bank.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This wine fridge uses thermoelectric cooling technology to maintain your set temperature, and its airtight door seal helps to prevent fluctuations. It has a double-paned glass door that blocks UV rays—a feature highly recommended by our experts—and adjustable legs ensure the appliance is stable, even if your countertop is a little crooked. There are a few downsides, though. Because it’s thermoelectric, this wine fridge may use a little more power than compressor-driven models, and its fan can also be a bit loud during operation, as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>14.5 x 20 x 10 inches | <strong>Temperature Range:</strong> 46–66°F | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 6 bottles | <strong>Installation Type:</strong> Freestanding | <strong>Zones: </strong>Single</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-serious-collectors-eurocave-pure-s-wine-cellar></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Serious Collectors</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>EuroCave Pure S Wine Cellar</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=eurocave-premiere-s-wine-cellar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ChkQdpSQ1VImZz1h7-6UWIew2V0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eurocave-premiere-s-wine-cellar-f586ef1d778246c9a2be41e53fa935c4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wine Enthusiast</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s so much to love about the EuroCave Premiere S Wine Cellar, making it a top pick among serious wine connoisseurs. It can hold up to 74 standard-sized bottles, giving you plenty of space for all your favorite wines, and its special “main du sommelier” shelving features adjustable "hands" that cradle each bottle individually to prevent rolling or rattling when you pull the shelves out. Plus, the unit is quieter and 60 percent more energy efficient than similar wine fridges, and it has a wider ambient temperature range of 32 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, which means it will still operate efficiently in rooms with fluctuating temperatures.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This restaurant-quality wine fridge is available with either a glass or solid door, and it has a full locking mechanism to protect your wine. There's even a detachable light that lets you examine bottles on lower shelves as needed. It is a freestanding model, so it can’t be built into your kitchen or bar, and while the EuroCave Premiere S is quite pricey, it's a worthwhile investment for serious wine collectors who want to preserve their bottles for long periods of time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>38 x 27 x 27.25 inches | <strong>Temperature Range:</strong> 48–59°F | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 74 bottles | <strong>Installation Type:</strong> Freestanding | <strong>Zones: </strong>Single</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-design-cafe-smart-46-bottle-wine-cooler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Design</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cafe Bottle Wine Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=cafe-smart-46-bottle-wine-cooler style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/xnYfRNlIQImGQovgfECP2InXIao=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cafe-smart-46-bottle-wine-cooler-5ac43cb5894643969268a6987366d4cd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Home Depot</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The majority of wine fridges have a very similar appearance with a back exterior and tinted glass door, but if you’re searching for something a little more stylish, the Cafe Smart Wine Cooler is worth a look. The brand is known for its attractive and contemporary kitchen appliances, and this built-in wine fridge comes in several finishes and has swappable hardware for a custom appearance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This wine fridge can hold up to 46 bottles at a time, and there are two separate temperature zones. It has a clear glass door and LED light wall so you can clearly see what’s inside, and it’s the only option on this list that offers smart features. When you connect the appliance to your smartphone, you’ll be able to adjust the temperature remotely, get alerts if the door is left open, and monitor the temperature on the go. Of course, the caveat to all this cool technology is that the Cafe Smart Wine Cooler is very expensive, especially when compared to other similarly-sized wine fridges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>34.125 x 23.75 x 26 inches | <strong>Temperature Range:</strong> 41–61°F | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 46 bottles | <strong>Installation Type:</strong> Freestanding or built-in | <strong>Zones: </strong>Dual<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-built-in-newair-awr-290db-dual-zone-29-bottle-built-in-wine-cooler-fridge></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Built-in</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NewAir 29-Bottle Built-In Wine Cooler Fridge</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=newair-awr-290db-dual-zone-29-bottle-built-in-wine-cooler-fridge style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/0iAeWotcEJ7EW9uJTdbYMe0tHsA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/newair-awr-290db-dual-zone-29-bottle-built-in-wine-cooler-fridge-b39d2bb8a0b746d4b04ba125f0d6988e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Home Depot</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have room to spare under your kitchen counter, the NewAir Compressor Wine Cooler is a built-in model that allows you to keep your favorite wines close at hand — it even comes in multiple finishes to match your existing kitchen decor. The fridge has a dual-zone design, which is perfect for hosts, as you’ll be able to keep both whites and reds at the perfect temperature for serving — no need to chill bottles in the fridge during parties. Just uncork them and pour!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the brand claims this wine fridge can accommodate up to 29 bottles, most people agree that it would be a very tight fit — 15 to 20 bottles is more accurate for its capacity. The fridge has a locking door with UV-protected glass, and its compressor operates quietly, so it won’t disturb you when you’re eating dinner or cooking in the kitchen. Plus, it’s reasonably priced for a built-in appliance, providing the most bang for your buck.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>34 x 14.8 x 22.6 inches | <strong>Temperature Range:</strong> 40–66°F | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 29 bottles | <strong>Installation Type:</strong> Freestanding or built-in | <strong>Zones: </strong>Single</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dual-zone-wine-enthusiast-classic-70-dual-zone-wine-cellar></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Dual Zone</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wine Enthusiast Classic 70 Dual Zone Wine Cellar</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=wine-enthusiast-classic-70-dual-zone-wine-cellar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/iv-vTXqn5-8kEFLwV5iQ_omeYMY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wine-enthusiast-classic-70-dual-zone-wine-cellar-f69245d46dfd4017bbb08ddf7a874214.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wine Enthusiast</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>Those with small homes</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Do you like to keep a variety of reds, whites, roses, and sparkling wines available at all times? If so, you’ll want a dual-zone wine fridge like this one. The Wine Enthusiast Classic 70 Wine Cellar allows you to store up to 70 bottles of wine at a time, providing plenty of room for all your favorite varieties. There are two separate temperature zones for different types of wines, and the whole thing is illuminated by a dramatic blue LED light, making it a focal point in any room.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This wine cooler has a triple-pane glass door that offers UV protection, and it comes with a key so you can keep your collection secure when you’re not around. It has wire shelving with wood trim for a polished appearance, but it needs to be freestanding — not recessed into a cabinet — and has a sizable footprint, so be sure to measure your space before you buy. Overall, though, it’s a really good value for a large dual-zone wine fridge.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>40.87 x 23.5 x 25 inches | <strong>Temperature Range:</strong> 41–68°F | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 70 bottles | <strong>Installation Type:</strong> Freestanding | <strong>Zones: </strong>Dual</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-small-insignia-8-bottle-wine-cooler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Small</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Insignia 8-Bottle Wine Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=insignia-8-bottle-wine-cooler style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/lSQUMZljjKBuoM8pocGDywXv1A8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/insignia-8-bottle-wine-cooler-1cc42314b8114b92b15c70fad5323b24.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bestbuy</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No room for a full-size wine fridge? The Insignia Wine Cooler is as compact as they come — and budget-friendly, too. This small wine fridge is only 18.5 inches tall, meaning it fits comfortably under most kitchen cabinets, and it has space for up to eight bottles of wine inside. It has a stainless steel finish that will match other appliances in your kitchen, and the simple, straightforward design is ideal for those just starting out on their wine journey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Insignia Wine Cooler has a freestanding form with adjustable feet, keeping it level on uneven surfaces, and it even has interior lighting that you can turn on and off with the push of a button. However, you’ll want to be cognizant of where you place this wine fridge, as its fan can be a bit noisy as it cools down your drink.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>18.5 x 10.25 x 20.125 inches | <strong>Temperature Range:</strong> 46–65°F | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 8 bottles | <strong>Installation Type:</strong> Freestanding/Built-in | <strong>Zones: </strong>Single/Dual</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-beverage-center-nfinity-pro-hdx-wine-and-beverage-center-by-wine-enthusiast></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Beverage Center</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>N'FINITY PRO HDX Wine and Beverage Center</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=nfinity-pro-hdx-wine-and-beverage-center style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/YWhq8d1fgPdPQ-860KGR7dYbRbA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nfinity-pro-hdx-wine-and-beverage-center-1e3e531e0b3b43bfa81f4048bd87380e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wine Enthusiast</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The N'FINITY PRO HDX Wine and Beverage Center has a convenient two-door design that lets you store other beverages alongside your wine. The wine cooler itself can hold up to 35 bottles and has dual zones for different types of wine, while the beverage center can accommodate up to 90 cans of beer, soda, water, or other drinks — ideal for a home bar or your kitchen. Plus, its compressor cooling system is 25 percent more energy efficient than comparable models, so it won’t run up your electric bill.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This wine and beverage center is ideal for families or avid hosts, as it allows you to store a variety of drinks in one location. The extra-wide appliance can either be built into kitchen cabinetry or used freestanding, and the sliding wine racks have an attractive wooden frame for a sleek exterior appearance. It really checks all the boxes for appearance, performance, and versatility. The N'FINITY PRO HDX is on the more expensive side, but it’s definitely worth it for certain households — just think of all the space it will clear up in your fridge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>33.6 x 30.1 x 22.25 inches | <strong>Temperature Range:</strong> 41–72°F | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 35 bottles | <strong>Installation Type:</strong> Freestanding or built-in | <strong>Zones: </strong>Dual</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-right-wine-fridge></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Right Wine Fridge</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Capacity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As you shop for wine fridges, you’ll see that basically every product lists a capacity, or how many bottles of wine fit inside. However, this capacity is generally based on standard Bordeaux-size bottles, which are around 2.75 inches in diameter and 11.75 inches tall. Other types of wine, such as pinot noir, California reds, and sparkling wines, have different bottle shapes that have a wider diameter. If you have a lot of these larger bottles, you won’t be able to fit as many of them inside your wine fridge and some bottles might have to be delegated to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>your refrigerator</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cooling Technology</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are two common cooling technologies used in wine fridges today: condenser and thermoelectric cooling. Thermoelectric wine coolers tend to be much smaller, but they’re also pretty energy efficient and quiet during operation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In larger wine fridges, you’re more likely to see condensers, which have a wider temperature range and can withstand changes in ambient temperature. The good news is that modern condensers tend to be more energy efficient than past models, making them less expensive to operate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Zones</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wine fridges are commonly available with either one or two temperature zones that can be operated independently. If you have a small wine collection, one zone may be more practical, but for more avid wine drinkers, experts recommend opting for a dual-zone fridge.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“With multiple zones, you can set the temperature for white (45–50°F), as well as red (60–68°F) service for the wines that you plan on enjoying soon,” explains Decaro. “You can also set zones for wine aging, which is usually cooler than red service temperature but warmer than white service temperature — 55°F is considered a nice sweet spot for aging.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Installation&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wine fridges come in both freestanding and built-in models, the latter of which are designed to be recessed into kitchen cabinetry for a more seamless appearance. Keep this distinction in mind as you shop, as freestanding units typically need several inches of clearance on all sides for proper ventilation. Built-in models, on the other hand, usually vent out of the front, allowing them to be boxed in.
