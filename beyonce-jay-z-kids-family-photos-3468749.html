Blue was right there when Jay presented his wife with the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV VMAs. The father-daughter pair were so incredibly proud of everything Beyoncé had accomplished and the family of three looked absolutely precious.<p id=content-paragraph-4>Of course, it’s not just awards shows where Jay has been seen bonding with his youngsters. A huge basketball fan, the rapper was spotted at the Staples Center on March 8, 2020, with his eldest watching the Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers play against one another.

Beyoncé stunned her fans by posting a photo of herself cradling the babies while wearing a gorgeous dress, and everyone was absolutely SHOOK! She also shared a glimpse of them in a video from her 2018 in review, which featured some footage from her and Jay’s vow renewal ceremony. The<a href=#> twosome looked beyond adorable</a> in their white outfits at the event, and they seem like such happy babies! Since then, the twins have been captured in photos <a href=#>during family vacations</a>, as well as in the Disney+ film&nbsp;Black Is King, which Beyoncé <a href=#>dedicated to her son</a>.<p id=content-paragraph-6>Fans have loved seeing this family grow over the years.
