Her makeup is praised and imitated by many of her TikTok followers.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But she didn't receive the same amount of appraisal when she debuted her no-makeup looks through a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TikTok video</a>&nbsp;on May 13, 2021, a day after she gave&nbsp;glimpses of her face without makeup in a tutorial video. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the 30-second clip, Monk revealed she couldn't put on makeup because she had a stye on her eyes.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As soon as she uploaded the video, her followers grouped into supporters and&nbsp;adversaries.&nbsp;People pointed out how she was nothing without her makeup.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>One commentator wrote, "She is overrated."

Then she displayed&nbsp;the hate comments and&nbsp;clapped back at haters, telling them it was all lie.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Her well-wishers were quick to support her in the comment section.
