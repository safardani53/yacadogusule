The 68-year-old actress kept the outing casual, as she sported a simple outfit for the outing. Catherine, who’s most well-known for playing Daisy Duke in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Dukes of Hazzard, </a>was spotted carrying a small brown bag while on her way out from one of the retail spots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dukes-Of-Hazzards-Catherine-Bach-mega-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>For the shopping day, Catherine rocked a large navy blue hoodie and a pair of gray leggings, along with a comfortable-looking pair of white sneakers. The&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dukes of Hazzard&nbsp;</a>star accessorized with a pair of sunglasses (and had her regular glasses hanging from her collar). She also had her phone dangling across her shoulder, and it seemed like she was taking a call, as she spoke into her Apple AirPods.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dukes-Of-Hazzards-Catherine-Bach-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Catherine is still most famous for playing Daisy Duke in the classic comedy series throughout the 70s and 80s. Her look of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>crop-tops</a> and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> short-shorts</a> are incredibly iconic, and the name “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daisy Dukes”</a> for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>denim short-shorts</a> is an homage to Catherine’s character. Even though the show ended in 1985, Catherine returned as Daisy for TV movies in 1997 and 2000, and she offered her voice to a 2004 video game based on the series.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>While Catherine is still most well-known for playing Daisy Duke, she’s continued acting well into the 2010s in a wide variety of roles, including the 2010 romantic comedy&nbsp;You Again.
