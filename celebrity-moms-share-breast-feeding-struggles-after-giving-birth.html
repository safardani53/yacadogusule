Breast-feeding is incredibly&nbsp;hard. If you don’t find it hard, you are rare. A rare, lucky person.”</p><p class=p1>Seyfried continued: “I feel like we’re all talking about it, but not enough still. Because I remember when I was having trouble, I mean, I was reaching out to [friends] saying, ‘I haven’t spoken to you in, like, a year, but how do you…?’”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Mean Girls</a>&nbsp;</i>star — who <a href=#>wed the&nbsp;<i>Life in Pieces&nbsp;</i>alum in March 2017</a> — gave birth to<a href=#> daughter Nina and a son</a> in 2017 and 2020, respectively. After dealing with her struggles independently, Seyfried has found a newfound “love” of <a href=#>passing on her words of wisdom</a> to other moms in similar situations.</p><p class=p1>“I have, like, a very, very, very perfect group of women in my life, and if I need to lean, I’m just, like, falling onto these people,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Veronica Mars</i></a>&nbsp;alum told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in 2019. “We’re all each other’s rocks. And it’s funny because when one of your girlfriends is struggling, you end up taking the role of the rock and then when you’re struggling, they do. … It’s a give and take, and that’s the best kind of friendship.”</p><p class=p1>Kardashian, for her part, <a href=#>struggled to breast-feed daughter True</a> — whom she coparents with ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Tristan Thompson</strong></a> — <a href=#>for “weeks and “weeks”</a> after her April 2018 birth.</p><p class=p1>“For me, it was so painful but I also was not producing a lot of milk. So I had to pump every time she was napping,” the&nbsp;<i>Kardashians&nbsp;</i>star wrote via <a href=#>Twitter</a> the following November. “I guess due to stress my milk was not coming in. I tried and I just couldn’t give her enough. So I had to go to formula.”</p><p class=p1>Kardashian continued at the time: “I <a href=#>tried literally EVERYTHING</a>!! Doctors came to check, I met with the lactation specialist, I did power pumping, I drink the tea, ate the cookies, did special massages etc. it just wasn’t working for me. Once True started loosing [sic] weight bc of it, I had to give her formula.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The Good American designer and Thompson — who <a href=#>ultimately called it quits for good in late 2021</a> — welcomed <a href=#>a baby boy via surrogate</a> in July 2022, <a href=#>the basketball star’s fourth child</a>.
