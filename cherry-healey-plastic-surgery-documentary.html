Society’s treatment of women is the problem.</span></p><p><span>"I do not judge, even a tiny bit, women who are having surgery, because that is survival.”</span></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Cherry Healey busts beauty claims in BBC's The Truth About Looking Good</span><p><span>Cherry, 37, knows her mind and talks sense. Her previous shows have explored topics like drugs, drinking and childbirth, and she even invited the television crew along to the birth of her daughter Coco, now eight, for her BBC3 documentary </span><i><span>Cherry Has A Baby</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve never had a less private moment,” she says. “Two people put their hands up my vagina without even asking. But childbirth is one of the most natural things in the world. It’s not shameful or embarrassing.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SMF09CHERRY2.jpg><p><span>And, she says, she’d have done the same for her son Bear’s birth four years later but decided nobody wanted to see that again.</span></p><p><span>Cherry is currently dating Carl Kisseih, 38, who works in advertising. They met online a year and a half ago and are taking things slowly.</span></p><p><span>“There’s something really fun about being girlfriend and boyfriend,” she says.</span></p><p><span>Do they plan to have children together?</span></p><p><span>“The jury’s still out,” she says. “He would like to, but I know the hard work it entails!”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000377140075.jpg><p><span>As part of her latest series, Cherry visits the surgeons herself and has found it actually made her stick two fingers up to what society expects of women.</span></p><p><span>“The more the surgeons prodded and poked me, the more protective I felt over myself. The more I thought: ‘Hang on a minute, I’ve had two kids, where’s the shame in that?</span></p><p><span>“I’ve done bloody well, you know. I’m a really good mum, I’m really conscientious and I put a roof over their head and I feed them and I send them to school with their homework done. Don’t you dare poke my Caesarean scar and tell me it’s ugly.”</span></p><p><span>Amen to that. This world could certainly do with more Cherrys.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000375147909.jpg><p><b>During the filming of your latest documentary, what was the most shocking thing you saw?</b></p><p><span>A Brazilian butt lift. They flip you over like this big piece of meat.</span></p><p><span>I couldn’t believe the indelicacy and brutality of it – you look like a</span></p><p><span>dead body. Then they syringe your fat back into your body and you can literally see the bum rise.</span></p><p><b>Was it mainly women having plastic surgery?</b></p><p><span>Yes – I couldn’t get away from the fact it was queues of women in the waiting room, then male surgeons getting into their Ferraris at the</span></p><p><span>end of the day. That was really startling.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000377140076.jpg><p><b>Can surgery be empowering?</b></p><p><span>A lot of the surgeons use the argument about it being empowering, and I’m not saying it’s not. There isn’t one set answer – it’s really complicated.</span></p><p><span>I met one woman whose boobs had really dropped and were incredibly uncomfortable. She had surgery and she feels lighter and happier now, and that’s empowering.</span></p><p><span>She’s made that decision. So until society allows women to be more than their tits and teeth, I don’t judge a single woman.</span></p><p><b>Superdrug is now offering Botox and lip fillers. Has it become too accessible?</b></p><p><span>I like that it’s more accessible. There was an unfairness before. It was so elitist, for the rich and famous only.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000203586561.jpg><p><b>Would you have surgery?</b></p><p><span>If I was 20 now, I would. I’d look really different. I hated how I looked; I didn’t like my body or my face. I thought I was really masculine. I’d just come out of a very hormonal teenage period, I was overweight, I’d had train-tracks and if I’d had access to surgery and money, what would I have had done? God, how much money have I got?</span></p><p><span>But you can’t undo that – it’s not like getting a haircut. There is something sacred about naturalness, because once it’s gone…</span></p><p><b>What’s stopping you now?</b></p><p><span>There’s nothing stopping me. I wouldn’t say never, as you don’t know how you’re going to feel in 10 years. I watched Megan [Barton-Hanson] on</span><i><span> Love Island </span></i><span>and occasionally I thought I’d like the phone number for her surgeon.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000257679105.jpg><p><b>Megan divided viewers with her decision to spend thousands on surgery – what’s your take on it?</b></p><p><span>There is an argument to say it’s empowering if Megan wanted to have that surgery. Maybe she felt like her options were limited, so perhaps being beautiful was about getting work.</span></p><p><span>It seems to me that she was very insecure growing up and her looks have become her value. Where have the influences in her life been to tell her she’s interesting and fun and has something to say and can be anything she wants?</span></p><p><span>So she’s picked up the message that if she wants to be something, she’s got to look smoking hot. And she’s been proved right. She’s now earning serious money because of how she looks.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000429641440.jpg><p><b>Shouldn’t we be trying to change that message?</b></p><p><span>Yes, but what’s easier? Trying to look prettier or changing everything that’s been said to you while also living in the fish bowl?</span></p><p><b>Where do you draw the line when it comes to changing your appearance?</b></p><p><span>I have spray tans, my ears are pierced, I wear make-up and my hair is dyed, but I think it’s about what’s going on inside. Have you developed your personality? Is your value in more than how you look? Are you trying to educate yourself? Do you give people your time? Do you look after your kids? Do you put your phone down and look people in the eye?</span></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p><span>Make sure you’re always working on your inside bit because that is who you are. And then if you want to have fillers, go for it.</span></p><p>Make your own choice and don’t be judged by anyone else. You can have as much filler as you want but if you’re empty inside, that’s not going to make you feel good about yourself.</p><ul><li><b>Watch Sex, Knives & Liposuction, 10pm, Thursday, September 20, on W.</b></li><li><strong>Hair:</strong> Dino Pereira using L’Occitane</li><li><strong>Make-up:</strong> Claire Ray at Carol Hayes using Mac.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5ZqbmlrZGp8pLTEq6myZZiarq2x2GanpZmjqbakedKuqaCdoq56pbvCrqSepqSWv7p7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
