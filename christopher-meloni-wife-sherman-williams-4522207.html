The happy couple have been so supportive of each other, and their love story is truly one for the ages. Christopher told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>&nbsp;in October 2022 that Sherman deserves a lot of credit for their marriage lasting over two and a half decades.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“It’s her patience with me, and I really mean that. She’s allowed me to grow at my speed, because she’s always been more mature and more levelheaded in many ways,” Christopher said. “She paints and I go in her studio, and it just makes me happy. We have her work all over the house. She wants to buy art, and I’m like, ‘I don’t want that. I want yours.’ ”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Below, we take a closer look at the interesting story behind the lovebirds’ long-standing partnership and see how Christopher celebrates life with his wife and kids.</p><h2>How did Christopher and Sherman Meet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/chris-meloni-wife-sherman-williams-01-embed11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Christopher’s wife may not be in the spotlight, but she’s familiar with the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>world of Hollywood</a>. The pair originally met on the set of a TV show in 1989, as Christopher had just began pursuing an acting career and Sherman was working as a production designer. Although Christopher described the HBO series as “immensely forgettable” to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>YourTango</a>&nbsp;in 2006, he recalled Sherman as exactly the opposite, explaining how taken he was with this incredibly unique woman arriving to set on a motorcycle with short blond hair and retro sunglasses. “This I gotta meet,” Christopher went on about his now-wife.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Continuing in his story,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Handmaid’s Tale</a>&nbsp;actor revealed that although he found a spark in flirting with the production designer, he was sad to find out she had a boyfriend at the time. Flash forward a few more years and the two bumped into each other again in Los Angeles, causing <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christopher</a> to finally take action by leaving a note at her house. “On our first date, we went to three parties, given by three sets of my friends,” Sherman recalled to YourTango. “The first was in West Hollywood. Every guy there was gay. Chris passed with flying colors. Next we went to a party given by Beverly Hills snootballs. Chris kept his manners in check and held his own. Then we went to a costume designer’s party in the Hills, where we drank beers from a tub on the porch. And I thought: I can take him anywhere.” Shortly thereafter, the two began dating and eventually moved in together.</p><h2>A Wedding to Remember</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>After four years of living together, Christopher and Sherman were ready to walk down the aisle –er, beach aisle that is. The two tied the knot in Malibu with a medieval-themed beach wedding and threw back shots of tequila to celebrate their nuptials. They couldn’t celebrate for too long, however, as Sherman had to run to the airport for a job in Miami, reported&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yahoo!Life</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The couple’s daughter, <strong>Sophia Eva Pietra Meloni,</strong> shared a series of photos to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>&nbsp;in 2020 of her parents celebrating in their 25th anniversary, tequila shots and all! “[M]om and dad ring in 25 years with shots of Patron silver. Love is awesome,” Sophia wrote.</p><h2>One Big Happy Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/chris-meloni-wife-sherman-williams-01-embed21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>As their relationship continued, the actor and production designer quickly found themselves torn between two coasts. Sherman preferred living in L.A. while Christopher was more a fan of New York City. The two finally agreed upon living on the east coast, raising their two children, <strong>Sophia Eva Pietra Meloni</strong>, 21, and <strong>Dante Amadeo Meloni</strong>, 18. in the Big Apple. Sherman also put her production designer skills to work by creating a beautiful living space for the happy family, featured in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Architectural Digest</a>&nbsp;in 2017. “What makes me happy about this apartment […] is that, while the views keep you very much in touch with New York, you’re also above it all,” stated Christopher of the family’s Hell’s Kitchen abode. “When I’m done working and come home, I can really get away, be in a cocoon. I never imagined living 60 stories above the city could be soothing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Christopher spoke about the joys of being a parent to&nbsp;People. “I always knew I wanted kids, as did my wife. My mother always used to say to me, ‘I’ve learned so much from you kids,’ and I didn’t get it. Now I get it,” he said in the interview. The&nbsp;Man of Steel&nbsp;actor also explained how his two children are very different from each other. “One is more of an old soul. I never used that term until they came out of the womb and I looked in their eyes. I was like, ‘Holy cow, look at you. You’re here to teach me,’ ” he said. “As well as the other one, who’s a young soul. It’s ever-evolving and a complete fulfillment of my life.”</p><p class=body-text>Christopher and Sherman celebrated 27 years of marriage in July 2022, which is quite an accomplishment considering the standards of Hollywood. Their longstanding domestic bliss has relied on&nbsp;“space, respect, trust, and freedom,” Sherman told Your Tango, also adding, “we just like each other.” Indeed, although what we see is surefire case of true love!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KhqaKrpKS9qbHRZqSepJ%2Bjtm7DyJ%2BcZquYmr%2Burc1mrqKknJ6urr%2BMbWxramJlhHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
