Below, everything you need to know about the final season of&nbsp;Claws, including the release date, cast, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/claws-embed1.jpg><h2><strong><strong>‘Claws’ Season 4 Release Date</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Season 4 of&nbsp;Claws&nbsp;will be premiering on December 19, 2021.

She informs the other ladies of her next big plan, which involves a drug theft right under the nose of “Uncle Daddy.” But in true&nbsp;Claws&nbsp;fashion, things don’t exactly go according to plan, as the trailer teases chaos and drama unfolding for Desna and her girl squad.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><strong><strong>What’s In Store For Season 4?</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>As mentioned before, season 4 of&nbsp;Claws&nbsp;will largely focus on Desna’s plot to steal Uncle Daddy’s supply of pills. The theft leads to an epic crime war between Desna and Uncle Daddy. But things get even more complicated when Quiet Ann, still blaming Desna for the death of her wife, joins Uncle Daddy’s side. Meanwhile, Jenn is trying to save her marriage to Bryce, and Virginia and Polly are both engaged in their fare share of crime tactics. As if that isn’t enough drama, Desna decides to hatch her next scheme: selling her pills via multi-level marketing. So clearly,&nbsp;<i>Claws&nbsp;</i>season 4 is going to be a wild ride — and we can’t wait to tune into the madness for one last time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KlmLCrXaiyor%2FOp2RtZWRrfXKBlm5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
