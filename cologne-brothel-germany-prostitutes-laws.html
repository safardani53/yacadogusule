Everything I need in one-stop shop.

He politely declines.</p><p>Erica says with a laugh: “We get Brits in every day. I’ve never had a British man with a small d***. They’re all huge. We love them.”</p><p>Across the street, at another mega-brothel, Das Bordell, bouncer Dimitri had less flattering things to say about British customers.</p><p>He jokes: “Often they pay the girls for everything but only end up touching and don’t have sex, because they are so drunk.</p><p>“We get more issues with other nationalities than the Brits. They’re just a lot louder than everyone else, but that is fine. They’re just drunk and having a good time.”</p><p>They are still happy to see British punters, despite an incident in March involving one drunk lad who was thrown out after allegedly attacking a girl and his mate retaliating by ploughing a car into the brothel’s glass doors.</p><p>Dimitri added: “But that isn’t normal for us here. Brits are normally great.”</p><p>Another option for sex tourists is the Eifeltor district, a short drive from the city centre, where women work out of old-fashioned static caravans which line a busy main road.</p><p>To show they are available to potential customers, girls sit in the lit windows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/thea-jacobs-visits-germany-prostitution-861356681.jpg><p>There is just enough space between each caravan to park a car, and sex with one of the women is 50 euros (£40). The caravans are a common sight across Germany.</p><p>On a Friday night there was a never-ending stream of punters pulling up, negotiating a price and going into the caravans for ten or 15 minutes before leaving.</p><p>While the country’s brothels are popular, escorts and practitioners specialising in bondage, domination, sadism and masochism also do a roaring trade.</p><p>Dusseldorf-based <a href=#>dominatrix </a>Chloe Savage has been welcoming Brits into her dungeon for years, and they tell her they cannot get their needs met at home.</p><p>She worries about what criminalising sex work will mean for people wanting to experiment with BDSM.</p><p>She explained: “People come here to visit me and other practitioners because they know it is legal, and it is safe for them to explore their fantasies.</p><p>“I have some clients from <a href=#>England</a> who fly over here specifically a few times a year because they feel safe and happy with my practices. They can’t do this back home.</p><p>“A lot of <a href=#>BDSM </a>is mental, rather than physical sex, and lumping it in with other types of sex work isn’t fair. Many people who have a predilection for BDSM think that they are sick, but they’re not.</p><p>“Criminalising this would be unfair and reinforce this belief. BDSM practices are safe when done properly, in an environment like the one I practice in.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/thea-jacobs-visits-germany-prostitution-860958823.jpg><p>Chloe’s concerns are echoed by male high-class escort Sascha, 51, from callboyz.net, who is regularly booked by English holidaymakers.</p><p>He told The Sun: “I was actually told by a British friend that I’d make a great escort, and now I have a lot of female clients from the UK.</p><p>“Escorting is different to the brothels people visit as it’s about creating a whole experience, which often starts with dinner or drinks and then moves into personal time. It’s not just booking a quickie.</p><p>“My British clients often book me as part of their holiday, and they tend to be more polite than other nationalities.</p><p>“They’re also very sophisticated, and many say hiring an escort is an empowering experience for them.”</p><p>Sascha tends to be booked by women aged between 35 and 60 and says he does it because he enjoys meeting interesting women and “interacting as equals”.</p><p>But he now faces the possibility of his job being outlawed, something he thinks will make it “harder to keep everyone safe”.</p><p>His pal, high-class escort Alba from ladies.de, believes it will make things more dangerous for women.</p><p>She says she does her job because she “loves sex”.</p><p>Alba explains she regularly works with people with disabilities who may struggle to find a partner in more conventional ways.</p><p>However, many former sex workers and researchers are hopeful the Nordic model will be implemented.</p><p>Sex industry abolitionist activist Elly Arrow believes it will protect women who have often been forced into sex work and who are abused by clients.</p><p>She told The Sun: “While we are a long way off this being made a <a href=#>law</a>, the fact it is being discussed is a huge win for survivors of the industry and activists.</p><p>“I’m not speculating when I say fear of assault is something these women experience every day.</p><p>“While there are rules in place, in reality sex buyers can do whatever they want to a woman and face no consequences.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“Allowing women’s bodies to be for sale has created a harmful element to society.</p><p>“While people might be tolerant, no one wants to see it next door so it’s remaining hidden, which allows awful things to happen, even if it is legal.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/prostitutes-demonstrating-new-prostitution-law-864960640.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4F6hZNxZ25nk6S5sLPNnmSbqp%2Bptaa4jKCcq6WRo8ZuvNGoqq2hpKrBpr%2BMpZiwq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
