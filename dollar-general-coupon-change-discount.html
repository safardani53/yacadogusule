Limit one per person. This coupon cannot be combined with any other Dollar Store coupons."</p><p>She said that is a red flag as it's different from the past when other coupons could be combined in certain instances.</p><p>She urged shoppers to be mindful when applying any coupons they may have.</p><p>The YouTube comments were positive for the most part.</p><p>One read: "Girl, you're a lifesaver. Thank you so much for telling us..."</p><p>Another chimed in, "Iâ€™m pretty new to all of this but have already accumulated a small stockpile and saved SO much money."</p><p>"My husband and I have 10 children and couponing has helped our family of 12 immensely!!
