Born in Washington, D.C., Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s onward and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem. In the 1930s, his orchestra toured in Europe. Although widely considered a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington embraced the phrase "beyond category" as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music. Some of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington's orchestra, such as saxophonist Johnny Hodges, are considered among the best players in the idiom. Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz. Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades.</p><table class=wikibox readability=7.5><tr><td class=wk_label>Birth name</td><td class=wk_value>Edward Kennedy Ellington</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>April 29, 1899, Washington, D.C, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>May 24, 1974, New York City, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Genres</td><td class=wk_value>Jazz, swing</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Occupation(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Bandleader, musician, composer</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Instruments</td><td class=wk_value>Piano</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1914–1974</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Associated acts</td><td class=wk_value>Billy Strayhorn</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/duke-ellington-cq1w-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Pianist Duke Ellington was born in Washington, DC, United States on April 29, 1899.
