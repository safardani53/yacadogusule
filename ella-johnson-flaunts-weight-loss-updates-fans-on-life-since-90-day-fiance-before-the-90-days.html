That would mean finally, finally meeting in person after so many setbacks.</p><p>But, late in the summer of 2022, Ella revealed that <a href=#>she and Johnny had split</a>. She had waited long enough.</p><p>Now, Ella has posted new pics — showing off a bright smile and flaunting some major weight loss in the process!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ella Johnson’s photos show how the Idaho native is doing through a series of snapshots of her current, post-90 Day Fiance life.</p><p>We see her smiling, standing, driving a tractor, and more.</p><p>And we can also see her showing off the very visible results of her 25 pound weight loss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Here, we see Ella wearing high-waised jeans and a bright red shirt, snapping a mirror selfie to show her profile.</p><p>“Been so crazy busy with stuff,” Ella captioned, admitting that she has therefore not “posted too much” recently.</p><p>“Just wanted to say thank you for all the love and support,” she expressed. “You all are great!!!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Here are some pictures for ya,” Ella offered alongside the series of photos.</p><p>She detailed that she has “been working hard here at the ranch full time.”</p><p>We hope that she is enjoying herself! She certainly looks happy, and she deserves that happiness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ella appeared on 90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days Season 5. She was memorable, and could be sympathetic or polarizing with viewers at different times.</p><p>Some loved her, some found her frustrating, and others found that her storyline fell flat. There was actually a pretty decent reason for that last part.</p><p>Ella and Johnny never met. Neither of them were catfishing the other or anything. Despite repeatedly making plans — in Ella’s case, expensive plans that cost her when they fell through — they couldn’t be together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Even at the Season 5 Tell All special, which as we know films several months (or longer) after couples film for the season, they had not met in person.</p><p>While many viewers can understand Johnny’s hesitation — because of the real dangers of COVID-19, because he is a single father — it was hard to believe that they had no options.</p><p>Or, even if they truly had no options, the writing was on the wall: they needed to stop pining and go their separate ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ella was, as we mentioned, divisive among some viewers. There were the usual elements of misogyny and body-shaming that are staples of 90 Day Fiance viewer reactions. It didn’t help that Ella received a cry-heavy edit.</p><p>Additionally, Ella is eccentric. While some of us find that fun or even relatable, there are fans of the show who will despise a quirky woman more than a creepy or abusive man. It’s not fair, but it’s true.</p><p>Finally, there were those — including Ella’s castmates — who felt that Ella had cheated on Johnny by sleeping with a friend, despite their discussions of having an open relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, late in the summer of 2022, Ella revealed that she and Johnny were over. And no, he never came to visit her.</p><p>Many of us would love to see Ella return for 90 Day: The Single Life.</p><p>But we don’t think that she’ll need the spinoff to document her journey to find new love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In fact, she’s probably better off dating off camera … even if we would selfishly enjoy receiving more Ella Content.</p><p>(And hey, for all that we know, Ella has already filmed for The Single Life or is filming right now. She likely couldn’t tell us if she were)</p><p>Either way, we hope that Ella finds her real-life Kurama.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WCcLHLpZhmop%2Bdu7S7zWadpZmlo8G0edaeoKCgpGK5sL%2FSZqypnJGpsrR5xZqlrGWfo3qttcWeZKyhnpiyboWPZpuasV2btqK6wp5km52WpL%2BmedOhnGZxYGKxosXSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
