He took the test again this summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Unfortunately, his luck was no better.&nbsp;<a href=#>E! News</a> reports that Shane has failed the bar exam for the second time in 2019.</p><p>He has no doubt spent months waiting for the results, perhaps confident that he passed, perhaps merely hopeful.</p><p>We are sure that this is a disappointment to Shane, who of course wishes to legally practice the law in California.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But this is also bound to be just as disappointing&nbsp; for Emily, adding additional stress to an already strained marriage.</p><p>Emily has admitted in the past that Shane’s studying for and failure to pass the bar has put a strain on their relationship.</p><p>It means that Shane is gone for extended periods of time. It is also an understandable source of frustration for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Emily may feel that Shane is stagnating without a license to practice the law, and taking that out on her in turn.</p><p>Combine that with the realities of both being parents into the mix, and that could spell real trouble for their union.</p><p>Then there is the extremely apparent problem in their marriage: the way that Shane speaks to and about Emily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ask Emily, and she’ll tell you that it’s not a problem, that it’s just his sense of humor. (We aren’t seeing the humor in it, and we doubt we’re alone.)</p><p>Shane is the kind of guy who essentially repeats the "ol’ ball and chain" phrase so often that it sounds like he genuinely resents his wife and life.</p><p>On camera, knowing that he was being filmed, he told producers that he did not miss his wife and children at all when away from them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Is it normal to enjoy some time to yourself?
