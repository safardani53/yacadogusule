Oh, my God, he’s so into character. You can’t approach him, blah, blah, blah,’” Roberts, who played Sal Maroni in the acclaimed flick, told Us Weekly exclusively earlier this month while promoting <a href=#>his stepdaughter <strong>Morgan Simons</strong>’ Pi BakeShop </a>and stepson <a href=#><strong>Keaton Simons</strong></a>’ music. “I got on the set with him and he was wonderful. He was sweet. He was approachable. He was kind. He was prepared. He was funny. In fact, I had several scenes with him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Eric-Roberts-Recalls-Working-With-Sweet-Heath-Ledger-Dark-Knight-001.jpg><p>Ledger <a href=#>died in January 2008</a> due to an&nbsp;accidental overdose. He <a href=#>shared daughter Matilda</a>, now 14, with ex <a href=#><strong>Michelle Williams</strong></a>.</p><p>In <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong>’s Dark Knight, the Australian actor appeared as the Joker opposite <a href=#><strong>Christian Bale</strong></a>’s Bruce Wayne/Batman. His efforts were recognized with a Golden Globe and Academy Award win. The action film served as Ledger’s final acting role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Eric-Roberts-Recalls-Working-With-Sweet-Heath-Ledger-Dark-Knight-002.jpg><p>Speaking to Us, the 64-year-old Best of the Best actor noted what a “loss” it was when the Brokeback Mountain star died.&nbsp;Roberts added that he believes Ledger’s daughter Matilda will see her father’s work in The Dark Knight “one day,” stating that the film is “part of his legacy.”</p><p>After Ledger’s passing, <a href=#>Bale, 46, played Batman once more</a> before passing the baton over to <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>. However, the 47-year-old Way Back star stepped down from the coveted part early last year. <a href=#><strong>Robert Pattinson</strong></a> is <a href=#>the next actor set to tackle the dual role</a>.</p><p>Roberts believes that Pattinson, 34, will be “wonderful” and “likable” as the caped crusader. “He will be heroic. He will be handsome. He will be the Batman,” the Runaway Train actor told Us. “I have infinite faith in him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Eric-Roberts-Recalls-Working-With-Sweet-Heath-Ledger-Dark-Knight-003.jpg><p>Aside from his thoughts on Ledger and the future of Batman onscreen, Roberts opened up about streaming stepson Keaton’s music and noted the benefits of his stepdaughter Morgan’s Pi BakeShop during the coronavirus quarantine.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Everybody’s having issues about groceries, except me, because I have an in. I have a cheat,” he said of Morgan’s company. “I have <a href=#>PiBakeshop.com</a>, run by stepdaughter, owned by my stepdaughter and I call her for food. So it’s fantastic.”</p><p>With reporting by Marc Lupo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyroZNiv7CuxKurrGWimrCiuMusZLCnoqC2r7OMsKCtoF2dsqLAx2ajnpyXmr9uu81mm5qqm2K4r7XGoato</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
