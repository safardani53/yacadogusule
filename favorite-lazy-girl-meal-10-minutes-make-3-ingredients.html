It’s so healthy," she began her <a href=# aria-label="post (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p><p>There were so many benefits to this recipe other than nutritional ones: “Mostly [has] three ingredients, and there’s zero chopping," she said.</p><p>First, she started cooking some ground beef but explained ground turkey or chicken could also be used.</p><p>When this was 80 percent cooked through, she added the other two elements of this meal.</p><p>“You’re going to take a coleslaw packet and a broccoli slaw packet – got these from Whole Foods, but also sold at Trader Joe and every other grocery store.</p><p>“I’m just going to add in half of each. If you’re really lazy you can do just one of these but I like the variation of both," she explained.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Lifestyle</h2></p><p>She was generous with her sauce additions, mixing in "fish sauce, coconut aminos, soy sauce, and some honey."</p><p>For good measure, she added some extra spice with a generous dollop of Sriracha.</p><p>“Let [the ingredients] soak in the sauce. It’s literally so good,” she said of the finished dish.</p><p>There were a lot of whetted appetites to her post, with over 16,000 liking her meal idea.</p><p>One commenter was grateful for the recipe.</p><p>“Thank you for this. I’d been struggling to find yummy quick dinners when I’m too tired to cook. My husband who does not like cabbage, loved it.”</p><p>Another said: “I just did the same exact thing for dinner. And I only added soy sauce and some seasonings. So freaking good."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/1f34956d-05ec-4de3-9459-68471c8800d0.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/cf483a24-c85b-4af3-9c75-6985ddf026fc.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FsbG5uY2mGcLLAr6aroaSaeq2t2bJkoKGioXquscClZGpoXaK2r8HTnqpmpZGgsm5%2FjKKloKqVmbamutOsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
