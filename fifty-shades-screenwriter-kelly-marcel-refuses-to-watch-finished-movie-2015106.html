Marcel severed ties with the author and chose not to sign on for the upcoming Fifty Shades sequels, instead handing the baton to none other than James’ husband, <strong>Niall Leonard</strong>.</p><p>Marcel spoke to novelist <strong>Bret Easton Ellis</strong> <a href=#>on his podcast this week</a>, detailing the tortured months she spent butting heads with James and watching director <strong>Sam Taylor-Johnson</strong> do the same.&nbsp;</p><p>“I very much wanted to do something different with the screenplay, and when I spoke to the studio and the producers and made that quite clear, they were very enthusiastic about that and kind of loved the things I wanted to do,” she explained. “When I delivered that script was when I realized that all of them saying, ‘Yeah, absolutely this is what we want,’ and, ‘You can write anything you like and get crazy and artistic with it’ — that was utter, utter bulls–t.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“My heart really was broken by that process, I really mean it,” Marcel continued. “I don’t see it out of any kind of bitterness or anger or anything like that. I just don’t feel like I can watch it without feeling some pain about how different it is to what I initially wrote.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The drama only continued for James and her team on Wednesday, June 10, when her latest project got caught up in its own antics. The writer, 52, <a href=#>revealed last week</a> that another Fifty Shades book called Grey is in the works from male lead Christian Grey’s perspective.</p><p>The book was scheduled to hit stores next week, but, <a href=#>according to the BBC</a>, one desperate reader may already have possession of the juicy novel. BBC reported on Wednesday that a manuscript of Grey was stolen from Random House earlier this week and quoted a Kent Police rep as saying a police investigation is underway. James has yet to comment on the alleged robbery.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ2inqSuerS0wJ2crGWjmL%2Bmsc2wqaKslad6rLHLpbBmpZGnsKa4jKucn62jmsBuwM5mrpqsk516p7XNoqqhnZRiurDCyJ5ka2hhan5xgo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
