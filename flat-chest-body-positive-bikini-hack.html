"Then, take it off, flip it, and reverse it."</p><p>Moments later, Banks was still wearing the bikini top around her neck, but the chest pieces were facing backward.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fashion</h2></p><p>Then, making sure the strings didn't get tangled, Banks crossed the two triangle-shaped cups over each other.</p><p>The straps formed a halter-style tie at her neck, and the cups fit more snugly against her chest in a literal "twist" on the normal style.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/d0fde5f9-c53e-44c3-a772-a88a4f3d68a1.jpg><p>But despite her triumphant "Ta-da!" at the end of the video, Banks faced several comments from viewers who insisted she did something wrong.</p><p>"You're cute, but it didn't work," said one man, seemingly confused by the video.</p><p>"I don't see any difference," said another who snubbed the tutorial.</p><p>Other commenters missed the point, but tried to compliment Banks anyway –&nbsp;but they came off as lecherous.</p><p>"Regardless of size, tons of guys would still tap that," wrote one man. "Save yourself the stress. No need to try and fake it."</p><p>Others were pointedly cruel and body-shamed her.</p><p>"Was this an ironing board ad?" asked one man. Another said the thing that would really improve Banks' bikini was "a bicycle pump."</p><p>Luckily, flat-chested women immediately understood what Banks was saying, and they were grateful.</p><p>"That's how I wear my bikini!" said another flat-chested viewer.</p><p>Women with larger cup sizes were envious of Banks and other women who could sport the adorable style hack.</p><p>"Me and my 34DDD’s watching this cause the grass is always greener," one woman wrote.</p><p>Another laughed at how lost the male commenters seemed, writing, "Guys on here are clueless."</p><p>"It’s not supposed to make it bigger, it's supposed to make it more flattering," a patient woman explained.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Haha thank you," Banks responded. She wasn't sure why people seemed so confused by her styling tip.</p><p>"I don’t know what everyone expected," Banks admitted. " This is not a magic bikini."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e8WaqqGhn6N8c3yVcm5ya2Fks62t02aaoZ2jqXqju8OyZKmno57BqsLEZpmio5mjtm60wJyiaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
