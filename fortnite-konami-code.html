Here's what you get when you use it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: EPIC</span></figure><p>You don't even have to play <a href=#>Fortnite</a> to know that the game is big on crossover events and special treats for players. A quick scroll through your social media feed and you'll probably see that the game packs <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Wick references</a>, a <a href=#>mode where you can play as Thanos</a>, and there were even rumors of <a href=#>'Godzilla' appearing in the title at some point</a>.</p><p>So it probably comes as no surprise that there was another easter egg packed into the game's "black hole" event ‚Äî and it's in the form of an old-school Konami code.</p><p>If you're into retro gaming or just grew up with older titles like Contra, then there's&nbsp;a good chance you're familiar with "the code." C'mon, you don't have to front like you've never used it before. There's no shame in admitting it, either. Contra was nearly impossible to beat. You basically had to memorize the game to the point that anyone watching you play it till the end beheld a murderous, beautifully rehearsed ballet of death.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's the deal with the Fortnite Konami code?&nbsp;</h2><p>In case you don't know what the code is, it's performed by pressing,&nbsp;up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, and start on your NES controller.&nbsp;Perform that and you've got yourself 30 lives, which helps in beating the game, but not as much as you would think.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: contra wikia</a></figure><p>Because the Konami code is such an important piece of gaming history, it's no surprise that tons of video game publishers,&nbsp;EPIC included, decided to litter their titles with easter eggs that can be reached after inputting this code, and Fortnite is now one of those titles.</p><p>But the code came about because of a massive in-game event, and we can't really talk about the Konami code in the game without discussing the following:</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fortnite's black hole.</h2><p>It all started with a massive blackout&nbsp;that was caused by&nbsp;a meteor, which just lingered in the middle of the Fortnite island since Season 10, decimating the entire game's map.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>RIP Fortnite: Battle Royale</p><p>FULL LIVE REACTION TO THE END! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ifX4CJcnEK</a></p>‚Äî Jack ‚ÄúCouRage‚Äù Dunlop (@CouRageJD) <a href=#>October 13, 2019</a></figure><p>Once everything was destroyed, players were just left looking at an enormous black hole, without much else going on in the game. You have to appreciate the moxy of EPIC to pull such a huge move: they're basically making one of the world's most played online games totally unplayable for who knows how long before Season 11 debuts.</p><p>What's even cooler is that if you didn't log in in time for the event,&nbsp;you missed it. Those who managed to see it, watched everything in the game sucked into the black hole, their own characters included. Check out the madness below.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How long will Fortnite be down?</h2><p>No one really knows for sure, but rumor has it that the game will be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">back up at 6 a.m</a> on Tuesday, EST, which means that the title would have been unplayable for about two days straight.&nbsp;To put that into perspective, when the Fortnite iOS app debuted for iPhones and iPads last year, it was pulling in anywhere from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.5 million to $2 million a day</a>. So it's safe to say EPIC lost a little bit of money for this stunt, given those past figures.</p><p>But what does the Konami code have&nbsp;to do with the game? Well, let's just say you're a Fortnite gamer who is constantly logging in and out of the title for a chance to get in some Battle Royale action before you go to school, work, take a nap, or do anything that's nowhere near as fun as playing video games?</p><p>Well, while you're waiting for something, anything, to happen on your screen, try inputting the Konami code and watch what happens.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you do the Konami code, you can play a minigame while you wait.</p><p>UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, B/O, A/X, START/ENTER <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nJy7ILHBnv</a></p>‚Äî Fortnite News (@FortniteBR) <a href=#>October 13, 2019</a></figure><p>Obviously the code's been modified a bit to adapt to a keyboard layout, but in theory it's the same exact code that pays homage to the ultimate 8-bit run-and-gun-jacked-dudes-versus-aliens adventure.&nbsp;</p><p>It also works on a PS4, in case you're playing Fortnite on that console, and every other platform the game is on too, it might just take some tinkering with the controls to get right, but once you do, you're presented with a fun version of Space Invaders.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Quickly, UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, O, X, OPTIONS</p>‚Äî üéÉHarveyüéÉ (@harvey_c_) <a href=#>October 13, 2019</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>What's even better than a Konami code nod, or&nbsp;the ability to play a silly-skinned version of an absolutely classic game in Fortnite, are some of the memes that are coming out of the blackout, and some of the reactions from fans who actually think that the game is over.
