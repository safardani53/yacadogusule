They just took dad to the hospital and he’s not breathing.’ It was very unexpected.”</p><p>She then delivered a memorable rendition of Gladys Knight & the Pips “Midnight Train to Georgia,” which she followed up with the <a href=#>Aretha Franklin</a>‘s “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman after judge <a href=#><strong>Luke Bryan</strong> </a>asked to hear more.</p><p>“The legend that is <strong>Carole King</strong> wrote it, the legend that is Aretha Franklin sang it, you need to sing it like the legend you want to be. Tall order. Don’t phone it in; make me feel it. Sing ‘Natural Woman’ to me like I never heard it before,” <a href=#><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a> advised the singer before her performance.</p><p>Perry, 36, admitted that Kinstler had what it takes, saying, “There’s not a whole lot of critiquing I need to do. I got a wave of full-body chills twice. That’s music. That’s true magic.”</p><p>Fellow judge <a href=#><strong>Lionel Richie</strong></a> added, “You actually have control of that amazing instrument.”</p><p>From there, Kinstler continued to move all the way up to the Top 24 and she shows no plans of stopping.</p><p>“Your voice quality, your confidence, the way you portray yourself on stage, it’s a winning package,” Richie, 71, told the American Idol contestant after her powerful duet with <a href=#><strong>Joss Stone</strong></a> on April 4.</p><p>Bryan, 44, called the recent performance “incredible”, saying, “I’m so excited to be a part of this, to watch you grow as an artist and a performer. I think there’s no surprise I’ve been a fan since day 1.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll down for five things to know about Kinstler as American Idol continues to heat up this season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bcv6KvxGaioqajqbmmvoxuZK2gmaO0tHnTqGSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqyYmnqiucSroJyZnmK2pbvLZp2rp56perPBzaecq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
