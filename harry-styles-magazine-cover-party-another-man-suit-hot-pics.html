He was a tall drink of water in a sleek black suit with his white shirt unbuttoned down towards his chest, showing off &nbsp;a s black tie underneath for extra edge of flair. His hair is&nbsp;growing out nicely after he chopped off his long locks for his debut film role as a British WWII solider in Christopher Nolan’s hotly anticipated&nbsp;Dunkirk. Without his trademark mane we get such a better look at his face…that beautiful, gorgeous,&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;face. We could get lost staring into those dreamy green eyes of his.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>[jwplatform bOw1GGHS]</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Harry’s celebrating his three magazine covers for Another Man that feature three very defining looks. In one, he’s wearing a scraggily shoulder length wig, looking SO incredibly much like a young <strong>Mick Jagger</strong>, 73, that it’s shocking. The sexy gaze, the pout, it’s all there. He changed things up for his second cover, looking like a young lad with a short, geeky schoolboy ‘do and a patterened turtleneck sweater while he gives a great big goofball grin.</p><h3><a href=#>Harry Styles hair pics: see his looks through the years</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>The third pic is the sexiest of all, where he’s not made up to be anything other that who he is…which is Harry Friggin Styles! He smolders at the camera looking every inch the superstar, with his short hair showing off his unforgettable face and perfect styling to include a fuzzy brown sweater with a black leather choker.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, is this the sexiest you’ve ever seen Harry? Does he rock a suit better than any of the other 1D guys?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5xe49vZqGZoqfGbr%2FTsqOeq12irqit2aKlnmWTpMOmvoypmKusqWKur7vToZyrZZ2Wu26%2F1KKrZqCfqXqxtcKsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
