Did 90 Day Fiance kill this entertainment behemoth?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We cannot emphasize enough that HBO Max has been knocking it out of the park for some time, now.</p><p>In 2016, DC Comics (owned by Warner Bros) first dropped the hints that it would launch a streaming service.</p><p>DC Universe, a streaming service and comics-reading app, launched with tremendous success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In addition to capturing nostalgia with familiar properties now available to stream, the service offered new material.</p><p>The highly anticipated new season of Young Justice helped build up hype. So did the Titans premiere.</p><p>Other hits, like Doom Patrol and Harley Quinn, followed. DC Universe outstripped expectations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It was only natural that the folks at Warner Bros took notice that their niche streaming app was a success.</p><p>Imagine if Disney had started with a Marvel-only app before launching Disney Plus with their full catalogue.</p><p>That is more or less what happened here. DC Universe’s television was rolled over into a new service. HBO Max was born.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>HBO Max’s timing could not have been better.</p><p>With the COVID-19 pandemic making theater-going either impossible or fatally irresponsible in 2020, people needed access to movies.</p><p>For the first time, “Home Box Office” truly lived up to its name — with free movie releases for subscribers. Some came out in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>HBO Max boasts a wealth of content from Warner Bros properties, including exciting blasts from the past.</p><p>More DC Comics properties aired, including new seasons of DC Universe shows.</p><p>The newfound streaming giant also unveiled a long-awaited surprise remaster of beloved scifi classic Babylon 5.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But where HBO Max truly blew other streaming services out of the water was its latest original programming.</p><p>The streaming service had some technical issues when it launched, it’s true.</p><p>But in 2022, the app was running smoothly … and absolutely dominating the streaming market.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Peacemaker remains, to date, one of the best television shows that anyone has seen, let alone superhero shows.</p><p>(Worth noting that the Watchmen series meets the same description … and also aired on HBO Max)</p><p>Then came the surprise hit, Our Flag Means Death, a comedy that remained the highest-in-demand show on streaming for more than a month after the season finale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Before HBO Max is nothing but a fond memory, you should check out most if not all of the shows that we’ve mentioned here.</p><p>That’s not just us — every show that we’ve mentioned is critically acclaimed.</p><p>Unfortunately, as we all know, we live in a corporate hellscape where giant companies consume each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sometimes, one company acquires another because merging technology or networks simply makes sense.</p><p>Other times, one companies buys up another just to destroy it because some fancy paperwork said that it was a good idea.</p><p>That’s how companies like Toys R Us get demolished. Seemingly, that is now happening to most of Warner Bros.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Earlier this year, there was something of a Red Wedding over at The CW.</p><p>Multiple shows — particularly series focusing upon BIPOC and LGBTQ+ stories — faced abrupt cancelation.</p><p>At the time, most assumed that this is because The CW is up for sale, and thus in a state of limbo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, it now seems to fit a larger pattern.</p><p>TBS and TNT’s original scripted content is all being canceled, including Full Frontal With Samantha Bee.</p><p>A single show can have ratings up and downs. Multiple channels losing all original programming is a massacre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Then, things got worse. This week, the world learned that Batgirl will never see the light of day.</p><p>The film is done. Warner Bros spent $90 million. The cast and directors were all excited for us to see it.</p><p>Is the movie bad? It doesn’t sound like it. Allegedly, Warner Brothers Discovery wants all DC movies to be huge spectacles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And then things got even worse.</p><p>On Wednesday, reports came out with increasing detail about horrific plans that Discovery has for HBO Max.</p><p>Allegedly, HBO Max is about to lose about 70% of its development staff as it phases out almost all original programming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If reports are true, then HBO Max will soon become a footnote in Discovery’s own app, Discovery Plus.</p><p>Can you imagine? We’re talking about one of the biggest and arguably the best streaming services.</p><p>It’s about to be just another tab in the app that people use to take funny screenshots of Big Ed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>(Like this one)</p><p>Already, HBO Max has “quietly” removed some films from the platform.</p><p>Analysts have explained that Discovery is basically pulling a The Producers, making more money by reducing and sabotaging their own content.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This has been happening for a while, actually.</p><p>People on social media have been going through the catastrophic and sometimes inexplicable choices that Discovery has made.</p><p>Discovery appears to be laying waste to Warner Bros properties … including several finished projects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When the first ominous whispers of Discovery purchasing WB made the rounds, it sounded like a joke.</p><p>You know on 30 Rock when the running joke is that NBCUniversal is owned by a company called Sheinhardt Wigs?</p><p>That’s what this feels like, but so much worse. How did this happen?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Simply put, Discovery has been making a lot of money filming inexpensive reality television and making colossal profits.</p><p>90 Day Fiance was a deviation from Discovery’s brand of documenting white, straight, Christian families almost exclusively.</p><p>But the franchise’s colossal success helped launch Discovery Plus … and also helped to create our new nightmare.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Right now, so much of the streaming world looks dismal. Even exciting projects</p><p>One hopes that the massive public outcry on social media will bully Discovery (or stockholders will) into making less catastrophic choices.</p><p>It’s hard to hold out hope for a better world. Especially when the feckless FTC allows margers like this to happen.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WFcLTBqGSmmahitrR5w7Kgp59dmbaleZhpZJ2ZqWKzqq3NnJxmo5mhuW7DwKulnqpdl7%2Bwv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
