Count Downton Abbey star <strong>Hugh Bonneville</strong> among them. The 56-year-old stunned audiences when he appeared on The BBC’s The One Show on Aug. 6, with his face looking so slim and his hair stylish and close-cropped. It used to be longer when he played Lord Grantham on Downton Abbey. While he appeared on TV remotely and was only seen from his chest up, his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>noticeable weight loss</a> wowed viewers, with some saying he now looks like British adventurer <strong>Bear Grylls</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hugh-bonneville-weight-loss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-2><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@rachyann_rachy</a> tweeted, “Hugh Bonneville is unrecognisable on #TheOneShow he’s lost loads of weight. Thought they’d got the name wrong til he spoke.” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@jurassicjen_uk</a> agreed, claiming, “He looks a different man! Bear Grylls from a distance.” One man named <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@mancunianmedic</a> joked that, “Having just seen @hughbon new slimline physique on @BBCTheOneShow my wife said ‘Dave. You don’t need to get as thin as Hugh Bonneville.’ Me: ‘Darling. I would settle for being as thin as Hugh was *before* he lost the weight’ (Long way to go, sadly).”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hugh-bonneville-weight-loss-splashnews-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Hugh appeared on the show to discuss a project he was working on, in the past he has revealed that a combination of exercise and changing his eating habits helped him slimmed down from when his wife gave him loving jabs about his softer frame. He told the U.K.’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Telegraph</a> in 2009 that he hired a personal trainer and had cut back on large portions and high carb foods after his wife ribbed him about being overweight.
