His father’s opponents have occasionally come after him when he was battling drug and alcohol addiction, and he has also been the subject of political attacks involving a scandal having to do with his laptop.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Following an investigation into his tax issues, it had been expected that Hunter was going to plead “guilty” to tax charges in order to avoid a gun charge, but in an unexpected turn, he pleaded “not guilty” to federal charges on Wednesday, July 26. A disagreement over the plea deal had arisen over the gun charge, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News.</a> Weeks after the deal fell through, Hunter was indicted on three federal gun charges in the U.S. District Court in Delaware, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNBC</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Hunter was charged with two counts of lying about illegal drug use when buying a revolver. The third charge was for possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful drug user. For two of the charges, the president’s son can face a maximum sentence of 10 year in prison and be charged $250,000 in fines.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Aside from politics and his legal troubles, Hunter’s relationships and family life have occasionally been the subject of public interest.
