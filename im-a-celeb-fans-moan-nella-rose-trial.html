She looked rather surprised herself. Does ITV think we're stupid. Theve taken her out so the nation doesn't."</p><p>A third chimed in: "why does they look shocked they are exempt on medical grounds."</p><p>A fourth added: "Nella and Nigel both looked shocked that they’re ruled out due to “Medical grounds” The producers want everyone to have a go at tasks.
