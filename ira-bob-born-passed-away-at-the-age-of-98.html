Ira was often referred to as the “Father of Peeps.” Nightclub Bettystar Wood remembered Ira on Facebook by posting a photo of him and noting that he was hurt in a fall and never recovered. The message went on to say,</p><p>“Everyone knows Peeps, and today, remember the man who brought smiles and joy to so many with his invention of the always cheerful marshmallow Peeps. He was the one in charge of automating the production of the popular candy chicks.”</p><p>They went on to say,</p><p>“Ross remarked most of all that his father would be remembered as a “true mensch,” according to the press. He was a kind guy who shared his strengths and was generous with his capabilities.”</p><p>The message concluded by adding that Ira’s family has asked that all contributions be sent to the American Technion Society, the Israel Guide Dog Center, or any literacy initiative.</p><h2>Ira ‘Bob’ Born became interested in the confectionery industry While in college.</h2><p>Sam Born, Ira ‘Bob’ Born’s father, was the owner of a confectionary named Just Born when he was born on September 29, 1924. Ira graduated from Lehigh University with a degree in engineering physics and then joined the Navy. He joined the Navy as a radar specialist and was subsequently promoted to lieutenant.&nbsp;Bob attended the University of Arizona and applied to medical school. He also assisted his father with his confectionery business. According to his son Ross, he became interested in the confectionery industry and scientific equipment. After acquiring the Rodda Candy Company in 1953, Just Born became well-known for its jelly beans and marshmallow candy. Bob, on the other hand, planned to design a machine to create the candy in less time. The firm was soon able to create sweets in a matter of minutes rather than 26 hours.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ira-Bob-Born-1.jpg alt="Ira Bob Born" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bob then suggested another sweet called Hot Tamales. Bob, according to Ross, was constantly eager to bring something fresh to the market. Bob worked for the firm for 40 years. Following his retirement, he became chairman of a literacy program for a disadvantaged community, where he was joined by numerous other persons.&nbsp;A few months before his death, Ira ‘Bob’ Born was still working. Ross reported that he suffered a fall and was severely injured, with no indications of rehabilitation. Ross said that his father’s elderly age was the reason he did not heal quickly.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ira-Bob-Born-2.jpg alt="Ira Bob Born" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In 1953, Just Born created the Peeps marshmallow dessert. Adam Rifkin, a filmmaker, and actor, obtained the film and television rights to the candies in 2014, wanting to develop a franchise. Bob is survived by his children Sara and Ross, as well as their better halves, Bob and Wendy, as well as five grandkids and twelve great-grandchildren.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigq5ldl7yjecGoqadloJbAtLHDZpiwmalirrV506GcZpmXmnqwsoxyb2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
