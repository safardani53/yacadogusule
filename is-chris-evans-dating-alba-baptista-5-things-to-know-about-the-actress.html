Yeah, I do,” he told Men’s Journal at the time. “I like pretty pedestrian, domestic things. I want a wife, I want kids. I like ceremony. I want to carve pumpkins and decorate Christmas trees and shit like that.”</p><p>Evans was previously linked to <a href=#><strong>Jessica Biel</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Minka Kelly</strong></a>. His last public romance was with <a href=#><strong>Jenny Slate</strong></a> after they costarred on the film Gifted.
