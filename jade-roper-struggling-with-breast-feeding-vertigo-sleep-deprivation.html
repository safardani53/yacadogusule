I’ve become more resilient this time around to letting the little expectations go, but the sleep deprivation during the newborn stage is brutal and I’ve hit my wall.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Bachelor</a> alum went on to write that she was battling “intrusive thoughts and negative self talk,” adding, “[They’re] wearing me down this week. I’m exhausted from trying all avenues to figure out breast-feeding issues. And I’ve been experiencing vertigo to where I feel I can’t function enough to be a good mom. I know I will survive this as I have before, but I feel so far down the rabbit hole today.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jade-Roper-Opens-Up-About-Breast-Feeding-Issues-Vertigo-and-Sleep-Deprivation.jpg><p>The Colorado native, who shares Emerson, 3, Brooks, 18 months, and Reed, 2 months, with <a href=#><strong>Tanner Tolbert</strong></a>, concluded, “I love my kids and I know they love me, but some days the love feels so big and overwhelming that I’m not enough to withhold it and these emotions spill out.”</p><p>Bachelor Nation members showed their support for the “Mommies Tell All” podcast cohost, including<a href=#> <strong>Ali Fedotowsky</strong></a> and<a href=#> <strong>Desiree Hartsock</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I honestly can’t imagine what it’s like to have three kids so close in age. Sending you love and strength. Take care of yourself. And ask for help,” the season 6 <a href=#>Bachelorette</a>, 36, commented, while the season 9 star, 34, wrote, “Allowing ourselves as mommas to feel all the things is so healthy and I’m so glad you share all the moments of motherhood honestly because it’s sooo true and OK to feel. You’re such a great momma! I’ll be praying for strength and restoration over you today!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jade-Roper-Opens-Up-About-Breast-Feeding-Issues-Vertigo-and-Sleep-Deprivation-Tanner-Tolbert-Emmy-Brooks-Reed.jpg><p>Roper previously spoke about <a href=#>her experience with postpartum depression</a>. “I was fighting a dark depression for the first six months after Brooks was born and no one would have known it,” the former ABC personality wrote via Instagram last month. “And fact is, I’m not that perceived person they spoke of anymore. … I’m fumbling through, learning as I go and leaning in as I get to know my baby and the new versions of my children and husband as they evolve and adapt and grow as well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajmZSaerO7z56pZqukp8Kos8uipaBlp57BqXnBq5yaq6Ris6axw6KloGWmmr%2B1tcaoZKyklZq9brDEqamirpGptrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
