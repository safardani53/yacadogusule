But I ended up having other scenes later that did have dialogue, so at least I had time in the morning where I was in hair and makeup to learn those.”</p><p>Though the New York Minute actor was able to film his scenes eventually, the moment still looms large in Padalecki’s mind. “It was basically the feeling of that nightmare where you’re naked at school,” he said. “Except unlike being naked at school, this was naked at school and there are cameras everywhere and it will be on film for all time. So now, these days, I’m known for my over-preparation. If there’s any scene in the episode we’re shooting, I know it backward and forward, because I don’t want to have that feeling again.”</p><p>Despite his traumatizing experience on set, Padalecki still has <a href=#>a lot of love for Gilmore Girls</a> — and his former costars. In April 2021, the House of Wax star weighed in on the ongoing <a href=#>debate about Rory’s boyfriends</a> on social media after <a href=#><strong>Milo Ventimiglia</strong></a> declared his loyalty to Team Dean. “Jared and I are really good friends,” the This Is Us star, 44, said during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon when an “I Heart Dean” sign was spotted in his office.</p><p>He continued: “I made the sign for some photograph that someone was looking for online or something. And after I made it, I just said, ‘Well, let me just hang on to this ’cause this is cool.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In response, Padalecki posted a photo on Instagram holding up his own sign — this one declaring that <a href=#>he “hearts” Ventimiglia’s character</a> Jess. “Ohmigod @miloanthonyventimiglia our offices are SO SIMILAR!!” the <a href=#>Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life</a> alum wrote at the time. “TWINSIES! (Well, I don’t have an Emmy nomination, but I DO have a ‘Best Body’ trophy that was worth every dollar @genpadalecki paid for it on Hollywood & Vine). Miss ya brother. Couldn’t be more proud of ya.”</p><p>Ventimiglia responded to his former coworker’s post with the comment, “I f—kin love you bro.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGaqpWZerGtw5qjnpubnnq0tMCrnKxlmJ7AbsPOq6qtZaOYsq%2BxjJ%2BpqKWXnrmuu9GeZKChoqHAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
