He bared his bronzed pecs and rippling biceps on July 2 while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">visiting Venice with his wife</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lisa Bonet</strong></a>, and their two kids, Lola, 11, and Naoko-Wolf, 10, days after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrating the wedding</a> of Bonet’s daughter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Zoë Kravitz</strong></a> to <strong>Karl Glusman</strong> in France.</p><p>After the photos hit the web, Twitter exploded with comments body-shaming the actor, who turns 40 on Thursday, August 1, for a slightly softer middle than in years past. But it also lit up with fans defending the star to the end. Wrote one, “Dad bod? You’re right. Looking at pictures of Jason Momoa def makes me want to call him ‘daddy.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Jason-Momoa-Lisa-Bonet-Dad-Bod.jpg><p>But despite dozens of fans coming to his defense, Momoa himself had yet to speak out — until now. Addressing a TMZ cameraman in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a video</a> the site posted on Tuesday, July 30, the Game of Thrones star said he couldn’t be bothered at all with the trolls’ comments.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When the reporter asked Momoa how the Guinness cake was at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his surprise 40th birthday party</a>, he responded, “Amazing. Anything Guinness is good.” (Momoa has said he knew he was in love with Bonet, 51, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when she ordered a Guinness</a> on their first date.) The reporter shot back that that wouldn’t help the dad-bod rumors. But the actor declared, “Well, that’s alright,” while gamely patting his stomach.</p><p>The interviewer then pressed, asking Momoa if the dad-bod designation offended him. “No,” the actor said, nonchalantly. Then smiling and shaking his head, he added, “Not at all.” The Hawaii native then got into the back of a car and said gamely, “Tell TMZ I’ll show ‘em my dad bod soon.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajmaOku265zqammmWZqLu1ecCtZJqknGK8p7LEp5uenF2Xxm6wwJ1km6eUYq%2BwsNhmqqGZnZq%2FtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
