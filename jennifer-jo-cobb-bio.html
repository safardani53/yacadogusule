Early Life & Family</h2><p>Jennifer Jo Cobb was born to her parents, <strong>Joe Cobb</strong> and <strong>Connie Cobb,</strong> on<strong> June 12, 1973, in Kansas City, Kansas</strong>.</p><p>Young Jenny got her passion for racing from her father, Joe, a racer, back in the ’70s and ’80s. And all Jo Cobb ever wanted was to be a racer like her father from very early on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-55.png><p>Jennifer would visit Joe’s races at every opportunity she could, which further intensified her hunger to become a racer.</p><p>Then, following years of practice in her local race tracks, the Kansas native started racing competitively at <strong>18 </strong>at<strong> the Lakeside Speedway </strong>and raced competitively at various other tracks and events before beginning her professional career.</p><h2>How Old Is Jennifer Jo Cobb? Age, Height & Body Measurements</h2><p>Jo Cobb started racing in <strong>2002</strong>, meaning she has been in the business for a staggering <strong>21 years</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, the Kansas-born racer stands at <strong>1.80 meters tall</strong> and weighs <strong>138.9 lb</strong>.</p><p>Similarly, Jennifer has long dark brown hair and stunning blue eyes that look beautiful with her contagious smile.</p><p>Most people falsely believe in the notion that race car drivers don’t need to be as fit as other athletes.</p><p>Contrarily, racers often lose up to <strong>3 kilos</strong> just from their sweat due to the extreme amount of <strong>G-forces</strong>. Jo Cobb likes to stay fit as it gives her an added advantage when it comes to endurance.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>You might also want to read: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mason Mount Bio: Stats, Salary, Instagram, Clubs Wiki >></a></strong></h4><h2>Jennifer Jo Cobb | Professional Career</h2><h3>Early Career</h3><p>Jennifer did race in some professional races in the <strong>ARCA Racing Series</strong> before making her <strong>NASCAR</strong> debut in <strong>2004</strong> in the <strong>Busch Series</strong>. She&nbsp;drove for the <strong>Keith Coleman Racing</strong> in a <strong>No. 50 Vassarette Chevrolet</strong> on her debut<strong>.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Jo Cobbs’ debut was nothing like a Hollywood movie as she crashed during the second lap and finished <strong>43rd</strong>. After that, she raced another <strong>34 races</strong> with the team before the season ended.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-54.png><p>Then, in <strong>2006</strong>, Jennifer launched her own clothing line for female race fans called <strong>Driver Boutique</strong>.</p><p>She also announced that profits from the sales would go on toward her racing career, which propelled her fans to buy the merchandise.</p><p>After that, the Kansas native spent the next four years racing in the <strong>Xfinity Series</strong> and <strong>Gander RV& Outdoors Truck Series</strong>.</p><h3>Later Career</h3><p>Although Cobbs did not achieve anything significant, being a female racer in a male-dominated sport was more than enough to gather a massive fan following.</p><p>Jennifer’s popularity grew even further in 2010 as she became the highest female points finisher in <strong>NASCAR’s</strong> history, achieving 17th place.</p><p>Consequently, the Kansas-born racer felt she was finally moving in the right direction for her racing career.</p><p>The following year turned out to be just as good, if not more, as Jennifer finished sixth in the <strong>Truck Series</strong>, which made her the highest finishing female in the competition’s history.</p><p>Also, she formed her own racing team, Jennifer Jo Cobb Racing, in partnership with the U.S Army Family and MWR Command.</p><p>After that, Cobbs’ next headline moment, unfortunately, came for the wrong reason. <strong>Mike Harmon</strong>, her fellow team owner and driver, accused of stealing racing team’s hauler and several other pieces of equipment made the news.</p><p>Eventually, the police found out that Mike had indeed stolen various items with his sister and former partner of Jennifer, <strong>Dave Novak</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-57.png><p>Even though the controversy was resolved, the damage had already been done as the <strong>Jennifer Jo Cobb Racing</strong> team’s image got hurt massively during the saga.</p><p>She worked hard to overcome the incident and get back the respect that her team deserved. Despite those incidents, she kept her racing spirit and is still racing full-time in the <strong>NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series</strong> with her racing team.</p><h2>Jennifer Jo Cobb | Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>Jennifer is reported to have a net worth of around <strong>$3 million</strong> accrued mainly through her racing career in the <strong>NASCAR</strong> series.</p><p>She also collects some extra cash from her racing team aptly named <strong>Jennifer Jo Cobb Racing</strong>, which was formed back in <strong>2011. </strong>Jennifer is also sponsored by many organizations, which further adds to her earnings.</p><p>In fact, the Kansas native has collected more than <strong>$4 million</strong> in career earnings.</p><p>Jo Cobb demands a yearly salary of over <strong>$200,000</strong>, which is respectable, considering she has never won a race.</p><p>Her huge fan following and popularity certainly play a part in her yearly income as she gets paid a fair sum from endorsements.</p><h4><strong>Also Check Out: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kia Nurse Bio: Instagram, Australia, Salary, Contract, Career Wiki >></a></strong></h4><h2>Who Is Jennifer Jo Cobb Married To?
