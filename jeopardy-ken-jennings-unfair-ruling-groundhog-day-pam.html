I knew it was maybe a problem as soon as it exited my mouth," she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> in reply to the first user.</p><h2>KEN-TROVERSIAL?</h2><p>During Ken's his first official week on the job in the now-airing Season 39 the 74-time G.O.A.T. scored enormous backlash.</p><p>As outlets like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>&nbsp;reported after it was&nbsp;<a href=#>covered by The U.S. Sun upon airing</a>, Ken "allowed a contestant to change his answer."</p><p>The champion–turned–host&nbsp;seemed to breeze by a now-controversial self-correction by reigning winner&nbsp;<a href=#>Luigi de Guzman</a>.</p><p>Contestant Luigi buzzed in under the "Cons" category - A painting was shown on the screen as Ken read: "Here's a typical 19th-century landscape by this British painter."</p><p>"Who is Constant?" Luigi answered.</p><p>Ken then prompted him to repeat himself - the host replied: "Say it again."</p><p>"Sorry, who is Constable?" the player then replied, and his answer was accepted in the deeply divisive moment.</p><p>It was made worse as later in the same game a female player was cut off from self-correcting by Ken, outlets like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> called it a "gender bias."</p><p>Luigi posted to&nbsp;<a href=#>Reddit</a>&nbsp;agreeing it was a sticky situation: "The rule went my way, but I can see how it could have easily gone the other way."</p><p>Show execs spoke up about the incident and said Ken asked the player to repeat himself <a href=#>because the host didn't hear him</a>, and his self-correction was allowed because Ken hadn't ruled yet.</p><h2>TOURNAMENT SEASON</h2><p>Jeopardy!'s never-before-done <a href=#>Second Chance Tournament</a> started airing on October 17th - Jessica Stephens, <a href=#>Molly Karol</a> and James, who beat Pam, have won so far.</p><p>The victor of each week’s tournament bracket will then score the two remaining slots in the&nbsp;<a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>&nbsp;which airs directly afterward.</p><p>When both conclude, regular episodes and&nbsp;<a href=#>reigning ace Cris Pannullo</a>&nbsp;will return in a month.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Ken will step aside from the iconic game show in January so that co-host&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;- now handling&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;- can take the reins.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Over the summer, he and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim</a>&nbsp;were officially announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late, great Alex Trebek.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/fans-spot-host-ken-jennings-769544154.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/fans-spot-host-ken-jennings-769544158.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/host-ken-jennings-mocks-champ-761433310.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZG5%2BdoWWaKGep6CWv6XFjKScp2Wamruvtc2gqmatnpuuqr6Mq6yloZ6ceqi%2Bzq6lnaCfnHqlrdhmp5qlXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
