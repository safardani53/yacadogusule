I promise you when I am on Jeopardy! someday I'm going to do this," he said gracing his chin three times for good luck.</p><p>"And only you will know that this is for you."</p><p>"So, tell my mom I'm okay."</p><p>Mayim was nearly speechless and said: "That is really special" adding before a long pause, "Let's get back into the game."</p><p>Fans loved the sentiment as one tweeted on the otherwise shockingly rough one, "Root against Jeff I DARE YOU"</p><p>Another tweeted in reply, "After his story who can?"</p><p>A third wrote, "Such a touching story."</p><p>A fourth gushed, "Jeff won my heart I gotta say."</p><p>And a fifth, "That IS really special. Bravo, Champ. Not a dry eye in the house."</p><h2>HOST BATTLE GETS HOT</h2><p>Ken and Mayim began filling in for&nbsp;the legendary&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>&nbsp;after his&nbsp;<a href=#>tragic 2020 passing</a>&nbsp;and a fleet of Season 37 celebrity guest hosts, including now-disgraced&nbsp;<a href=#>Mike Richards</a>.</p><p>The fact that the hosting slot is still undecided has earned quite the debate, as the&nbsp;late Alex&nbsp;had hosted since 1984 - a new host could be announced any day.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>show's ratings nearly doubled</a>&nbsp;to 9.7M viewers when&nbsp;Ken made his first appearance.</p><p>When&nbsp;Mayim took over her hosting duties the headcount dropped to 5.9 million viewers during a college championship and&nbsp;indeed,&nbsp;<a href=#>she hasn't bested Ken's ratings since during Season 38.</a></p><p>Mayim was a front-seat passenger for Ryan Long's recent 16-game streak - as many players said he was their "favorite contestant ever,"&nbsp;<a href=#>he similarly shared a Q&A story that gave Mayim "chills" about spending more time with his son.</a></p><p>But while fans have found Mayim to be a perfectly palatable presence, hundreds have tweeted about her off-putting poise during the typically enjoyable Q&A shares.</p><p>Mayim, who studied neuroscience,&nbsp;<a href=#>replied to one contestant's beautiful autism testing Q&A story with a joke:</a>&nbsp;"Glad to hear spitting in a tube went better than taking blood," she bluntly said.</p><p><a href=#>Mayim had another joke that flatlined</a>&nbsp;with fans - she insulted a doctor by saying he was "just an anesthesiologist, not a surgeon" while making a claw motion with her hand.</p><p>She also recently made an&nbsp;<a href=#>off-color joke about marijuana</a>&nbsp;and seemed to misunderstand the&nbsp;<a href=#>legacy of the band Queen</a> during the savored storytelling segment.</p><p>Fans have also found Mayim to be&nbsp;<a href=#>slow with simply ruling responses correct or not in general</a> during gameplay.</p><p>One Twitter user wrote on Mayim's hosting hesitancy, "She's laggy, I think often it's because she's waiting for cues from the producers, but someone said it might be due to her being edited a lot.</p><p>"The thing about Ken he actually knows the answers...because he's that guy."</p><p>“I'm handing the keys back to the talented actor-producer-writer-director (!) Mayim Bialik for a few months," the fan-favorite&nbsp;<a href=#>surprisingly tweeted</a>&nbsp;in May, adding, “We are lucky to have her! I'll be back before the end of the season.”</p><p>Since then, Mayim has also faced fan fury when a player's signature was ruled too sloppy in FJ though she had seemingly written "Harriet Tubman."</p><p>And last night - though not the actress-turned host's fault - there was <a href=#>ironically a typo in Final Jeopardy just days after the spelling snub</a> which couldn't have come at a worse time.</p><p>Canadian tattoo-toting tutor&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>beloved rideshare driver Ryan</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schneider</a>, Matt Amodio, weatherman Eric Ahasic, "$2 titan" Megan - all from this wildly streak-wielding season - will compete in the Tournament of Champions in November.</p><p><a href=#>Mattea</a>&nbsp;- whose run ended the day before Ken shared his podium pause - stated&nbsp;<a href=#>afterward they wanted Ken to take over</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>"As a contestant, there is something really special about being on stage with the greatest player of all time," Mattea told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vulture</a>.</p><p>Jeff will go for win number three tomorrow night - Jeopardy! airs at 7 pm ET on ABC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-8.04.03-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000735371713-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000727325769-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htZmeGcYGWaKGep6CWv6XFjKaYsqGdYq%2BqrcuiomailZuzbsPIp6Weql2gsq95x6iqrWWimsC2uNOsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
