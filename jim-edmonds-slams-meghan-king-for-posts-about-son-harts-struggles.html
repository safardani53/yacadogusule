In her post, King explained that she was particularly concerned that he wouldn’t be potty trained before he starts school next month.</p><p>“<a href=#>Hart is afraid of the toilet (I think)</a> and I’ve tried every motivator on the planet,” King wrote at the time. “The clock is ticking ⏰ as school requires him to be potty trained and it starts in a month! Any words of wisdom from <a href=#>others who have children with sensory issues</a>, etc is much much appreciated (and NECESSARY at this point!).”</p><p>In a video, she explained that things had progressed to the point where <a href=#>she promised to get him a cat if he was potty trained</a>. “He did … pee on the toilet today and he said, ‘Can I get the cat now?’ No, Hart, you can’t. You have to be fully potty trained, that’s not how this works,” King explained. “So we might be getting a cat. I hope we’re getting a cat.”</p><p>Despite trying out different methods to find one that works for the toddler, the “Intimate Knowledge” podcast cohost asked her followers to share <a href=#>what worked for them when it came time to potty train</a> their children with sensory issues. “I will do anything I can,” she explained. “I know he can do it, he just has to do it. Help!”</p><p>King and Edmonds — who also <a href=#>share daughter Aspen</a>, 5, and <a href=#>Hart’s twin brother, Hayes</a>, 4 — have had a contentious relationship since their split. “<a href=#>We have [a worse] relationship</a> than we did when we split up,” the former reality TV personality said during an appearance on <a href=#><strong>Caroline Stanbury</strong></a>‘s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-ml-dynamic=true data-ml-dynamic-type=sl data-orig-url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/divorced-not-dead/id1524317541 data-ml-id=0 data-ml=true data-xid=fr1658418497272dij data-feature=null,track_events data-skimlinks-tracking=xid:fr1658418497272dij>“Divorced Not Dead” podcast</a> earlier this month. “It’s horrible. It’s so detrimental for the kids [and] for us as individuals.”</p><p>King added that the pair only <a href=#>communicate via the court-monitored app My Family Wizard</a>, and only about their children. “It makes me feel safer because it makes me feel like the verbal abuse will be toned down a little bit more,” King said. “Unfortunately — and shockingly — that’s not always the case, but it does give me a little bit more solace knowing that I have eyes that can be on it.”</p><p>The duo <a href=#>called it quits in October 2019 amid rumors</a> that Edmonds had been unfaithful. He denied the cheating claims, telling Us Weekly at the time, “<a href=#>Regrettably, I had a lapse in judgment</a>. I engaged in an inappropriate conversation with this person. At no time was there any type of relationship or physical contact. Absolutely none.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us exclusively confirmed in May 2021 that their divorce had been finalized. <a href=#>The former athlete got engaged to <strong>Kortnie O’Connor</strong></a> two months later, while <a href=#>King wed <strong>Cuffe Owens</strong></a> in October 2021 after a whirlwind romance. They split two months later, and <a href=#>their marriage has since been annulled</a>.</p><p>King has previously spoken about <a href=#>the struggles she has coparenting her children with Edmonds</a>, telling Us exclusively in February that <a href=#>she and her ex-husband “struggle” to communicate</a> with one another. “I don’t know what [coparenting] is. Like, I don’t. I’d be the one to get advice,” she said at the time. “In order to coparent, you have to communicate right? Yeah, so that would be a good start. … Jim hates me. It’s horrible.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajoZ1isqW5zqebrGWjoa6uv4ymnKCgkaN6rLXNoGSfp6JivbC%2F06xkmpqfqsFuv86nZKGZoqnAbr%2FTq6ygn5yawHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
