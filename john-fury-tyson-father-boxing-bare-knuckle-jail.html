I’m not allowed in the country.”</p><p>He's appeared on BT Sport, and was <a href=#>critical of Tyson's trainer Ben Davison</a> after his son struggled to overcome Otto Wallin, surviving a nasty gash on his eye that required plastic surgery to fix.</p><p>It was no coincidence that Davison was relieved of his duties after that fight.</p><p>He told BT Sport: “I’ve never seen him as bad.</p><p>“He looked weight-drained, he looked like he’d left it all in the gym to be honest with you."</p><p>Not mincing his words, he added: “I’m being honest about it, he’s my son, I’m a straight talker, that’s the worst I’ve seen my son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000539558260-e1581511322644.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000201776646.jpg><p>“But what I can say? I’m very proud of the way he mauled his way through it, he showed world class heart and he will come again.</p><p>“He needs to go back to the drawing board and see what’s gone wrong here. And be honest to look in the mirror and say, ‘Things ain’t gone right.’</p><p>“He needs to look where he’s gone wrong. I’ve half an idea, but that’s for my own.”</p><p>But John has since seen Tyson overcome Deontay Wilder twice, before seeing off Whyte to enter retirement unbeaten.</p><p>However, it's now reckoned Fury is lining up a stunning comeback with a <a href=#>trilogy against Derek Chisora</a> or match-up against <a href=#>Hafthor Bjornsson in his sights</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH5xhZNucHBvX5%2B8qbqMn6yrsV2pxrS7zWadmqyYmr9urs6xoKefXZeus7GMpKWum5uhsm62wKKjaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
