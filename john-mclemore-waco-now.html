The raid was conducted by the federal government against the <a href=#>Branch Davidians</a>, who they knew to be hoarding firearms.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The story made national news at the time, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John McLemore</a> of KWTX-TV was the only local reporter on the ground who witnessed and filmed the whole thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is John McLemore now?</h2><p>John and his team were tipped off to the fact that the ATF would be conducting its raid, which resulted in extensive violence and loss of life, with enough warning to arrive at the scene. As a result, John's team filmed the entire raid, and he occasionally interjected with commentary on what they were experiencing. In the aftermath of the firefight, four federal agents and five Branch Davidians had died. John then transported some of the wounded to the hospital.</p><p>In the aftermath of the raid, John became something of a celebrity as one of only a few people who could speak to what happened during the raid. Eventually, though, reports emerged suggesting that John had warned the Branch Davidians in advance that the raid would be taking place. He was seen as an accomplice, and many viewed him as partially responsible for the death of the federal agents.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After that, he received numerous death threats and even lost his job. John has always denied the allegations and even sued several of the stations that reported that he had tipped off the Branch Davidians. Ultimately, though, John lost that lawsuit.</p><p>Because he couldn't be hired by another news outlet, John became a congressional press secretary and then eventually became the director of corporate communications at Life Partners, Inc.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He then took a role as senior advisor of global public affairs and crisis communications at ConocoPhillips. In 2014, John opened McLemore P.R. Consulting LLC, a consulting firm that provides guidance to organizations on interacting with the public and the government.</p><p>He currently lives in Houston, Texas, and appears to be single at least for the moment. Although his news reporting career may have ended after Waco, he certainly landed on his feet.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Thanks to the Netflix series, curiosity about Waco has peaked recently.</h2><p>Thanks in large part to the Netflix series, there has been a spike in curiosity about the wide array of people who were in Waco <a href=#>during the raid,</a> and <a href=#>where their lives have taken</a> them in the years since. Part of the intrigue around the story comes from the ambiguity in what actually happened on the day when violence broke out.</p><p>A stand-off between the Branch Davidians and federal agents lasted for more than 50 days. The raid was designed to put an end to the conflict. It isn't clear which side fired shots first, but the resulting bloodshed was the kind of spectacle that's rarely captured in real-time. John's footage was the subject of morbid curiosity from a public who had already been following the raid for weeks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ypuoymmqWdnaS%2FpnnWmpqoZZ6kxA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
