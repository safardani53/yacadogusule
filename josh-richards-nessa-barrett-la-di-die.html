She just has such a care and a passion for it, and it’s so amazing to see everyone else start to realize how talented she is,” Josh told HL. ” I think this ‘La Di Die’ song is going to probably be the biggest one out and it’s definitely just super cool for me because I get to sit back and watch two of my best friends in the entire world become rock stars.” So sweet!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Josh spoke to HL after revealing his new entrepreneurial venture into production! In partnership with Unrealistic Ideas, the production company led by <strong>Mark Wahlberg</strong>, <strong>Stephen Levinson</strong> and<strong> Archie Gips</strong>, the TikToker is bringing his expertise in Gen Z content with the new joint venture called CrossCheck Studios, LLC. “We’re definitely going to be focusing on a lot of unscripted content doing a bunch of docuseries-type content,” Josh explained. “You’ll see it on places like Snapchat or Facebook Watch. The goal of the production company is to be this home to Gen Z, if you want to create quality content.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Josh-Richards-Excl-Interview-SplashNews-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Josh added that his famous friends will also play a major role in his new venture! “I think that’s definitely one of the cool parts about this production company.
