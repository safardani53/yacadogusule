The lively switch up was brought to life by celebrity hairstylist <strong>Dimitris Giannetos</strong>, who has also worked his magic on <strong>Amal Clooney</strong>, <strong>Ciara</strong>, <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong> and more. Giannetos credited products from <a href=#>Moroccanoil</a> and Good Hair Day via Instagram as key components to turning Beckinsale into a blonde bombshell.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Beckinsale paired her new ‘do with a textured babydoll dress by Self-Portrait, which featured a lace color and a bow at the neckline, and a pair of towering platform heels.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Her sunny crown is a drastic change from her signature golden brown locks, which she donned at Elle’s Women in Hollywood awards on Tuesday, December 5.
