Tequila shots after a successful show is what ultimately sealed the deal for the pair and <a href=#>on their wedding day in December 2017</a>, the couple toasted with tequila <a href=#>alongside their guests in Mexico</a>.</p><p>The duo’s romance hasn’t been without its hiccups, however, with Ballerini previously joking that Evans burned the pancakes while <a href=#>asking her to marry him</a> in December 2016.</p><p>“Loving him has been the greatest gift of my life. And now I get to do it for life,” <a href=#>she wrote via Instagram</a> at the time after trolling the “Love Is Real” crooner for his kitchen proposal.</p><p>When Evans released his Things That We Drink To album in October 2018, he revealed that a lot of the songs paid homage to his relationship with <a href=#>the “Half of My Hometown” singer</a>.</p><p>“It’s my story. It’s leaving behind everything and everyone you know to chase down a Country Music dream on the other side of the world. It’s the excitement of the unknown, its the fun, it’s the loneliness & it’s the struggle,” he <a href=#>wrote via Instagram</a> at the time. “Its losing someone and finding the strength to keep your head up and make them proud. It’s meeting a girl, falling hopelessly, and marrying the love of your life.”</p><p>The <a href=#>“Hole in the Bottle” songstress</a> later revealed that she had an “instant connection” with Evans, which played a part in their whirlwind romance.</p><p>“I’ve always loved the idea of relationships and love and all that, but I wasn’t sure I wanted to do the marriage thing,” Ballerini told <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> in August 2020. “My parents got divorced so I was kind of always really aware of that. As soon as I met him, he was just careful with the way that I love. And I always felt very safe loving him.”</p><p>Three years into their marriage, Evans <a href=#>gushed over his wife</a> via Instagram. “Best 3 years of my life. Luckiest guy in the world. Happy Anniversary baby,” he wrote alongside a cozy couple snap in December 2020.</p><p>Nearly one year later, <a href=#>the “Day Drunk” crooner praised Ballerini</a> for bringing out the “artist and poet” in him in celebration of her birthday in September 2021. The “I Quit Drinking” singer then returned the favor by pointing out a sweet gesture her husband did on her special day.</p><p>“It’s the running through a restaurant with a dozen roses today for me 😍,” she replied.</p><p>Less than one year later, however, <a href=#>news broke that Ballerini filed for divorce</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Friends, I’ve always tried my best to share my life with you in a real and vulnerable way, while also protecting layers of my personal life as they unfold. This is now public record so I wanted you to hear from me directly that I am going through a divorce,” the “Heartfirst” singer wrote via Instagram Stories. “This deeply difficult decision is the result of a journey of love, growth, and effort that ultimately has come to an end. It’s hard to find the words here … but I feel extremely grateful for the years of marriage to Morgan and hopeful for the next seasons.”</p><p>Scroll down to relive Ballerini and Evans’ sweetest relationship moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKa40p6YZpqRobmmvsinoGaZnpl6rrvRoJinZZWrrq%2B%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2asmaKyrbXNnmSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
