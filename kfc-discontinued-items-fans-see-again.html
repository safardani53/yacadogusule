WEDGES</h2><p>Unlike most <a href=#>fast food</a> franchises, KFC did not have your typical thin french fries for a side.</p><p>Instead, they had potato wedges: large, crispy potato chunks that retained the skin of the potato.</p><p>The wedges debuted in the early 90s and became another starchy option for KFC eaters to pair with their meal beside the usual mashed potatoes and gravy.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON FAST FOOD">READ MORE ON FAST FOOD</h2><p>Yet, in 2020, KFC swapped out the wedges for seasoned, shoestring fries.</p><p>The change has not sat well with all fans.</p><p>"Now idk who the hell told KFC to switch to fries instead of wedges but they need to take that off the menu," one user griped on Twitter.</p><p>"Kfc had no business taking potato wedges off the menu smh," said another.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><h2>2. HONEY BBQ WINGS</h2><p>In the early 2000s, KFC came out with a line of Honey BBQ flavored wings, an instant hit with fans.</p><p>Yet, the wings never became a permanent menu item, as they only made brief reappearances over the next two decades.</p><p>However, there is still a vocal contingent of fans who clamor for the wings' permanent return.</p><p>Bring Back Honey Barbeque Wings at KFC is a <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook </a>page with more than 1,500 followers.</p><h2>3. GRILLED CHICKEN</h2><p>In the late 2000s, KFC had another interesting addition: grilled chicken.</p><p>The move was to accommodate more health-conscious customers but never sold well enough to become a staple, according to a Reddit poster who claimed to have worked at the chain.</p><p>"We stopped selling grilled chicken because it didn't sell enough and didn't hold as long as the fried stuff," the poster claimed.</p><p>Yet, the chicken still has its fans.</p><p>"Hear me outâ€¦ please consider bringing grilled chicken back," one user tweeted at KFC.</p><h2>4. LITTLE BUCKET PARFAIT</h2><p>While KFC is not know for its sweet treats, it does offer a limited dessert menu.</p><p>And until 2012, it offered what was called a "Little Bucket Parfait."</p><p>The parfait included crushed graham cracker and chocolate.</p><p>And fans are still annoyed that it's no longer on the menu.</p><p>There is currently a Change.org <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">petition</a> to "Bring back the Little Bucket Parfaits at KFC."</p><p>So far, it has 2,790 signatures, including two in the last day.</p><h2>5. POPCORN CHICKEN COMBO</h2><p>Just last month, many fans were outraged on reports that KFC was <a href=#>removing </a>its popcorn chicken from the menu to make room for new items.</p><p>"NO WAIT WHAT NONONONONO," one Twitter user exclaimed upon hearing the rumor.</p><p>It turns out, the news is only partially true.</p><p>While the Popcorn chicken combo option has been bumped from the menu, popcorn chicken as a side will still be sold at many locations, according to a report from <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tasting Tables.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Check out the new offerings from <a href=#>Taco Bell</a>.</p><p>And read about the return of a popular <a href=#>McDonald's </a>chicken sandwich.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbINxgZdxb2ijlph6pbXSnKanrJmjwqawjKKrnqWjYrOiutJmqp6dXZa0orXNaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
