with spinach, broad beans and cheese.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

pastry case” – and cooks can decide whether to do it with ready-made pastry or from scratch.</p><p>But how easy is it to make?</p><p>A novice cook and non-existent baker, The Sun’s Hayley Minn tried out the recipe both ways, for <a href=#>King</a> and country.</p><p>Here’s how she got on..</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON CORONATION">READ MORE ON CORONATION</h2><h2 class=has-text-align-center>The ingredients</h2><p>I WOULD have thought that a recipe chosen for the nation to make would consist of predominantly cupboard staples, but unfortunately that’s not the case.</p><p>The first hurdle I came up against was finding three of the ingredients.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/568150-sun-sun-features-coronation-810898380.jpg><p>I had to go to a couple of different shops to get fresh tarragon and broad beans for the filling and lard for the pastry.</p><p>It seems strange that the recipe recommends the pastry be made with lard anyway, as it’s the only non-vegetarian ingredient.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>It can easily be substituted for butter, which I’d recommend.</p><p>Or, better yet, just buy ready-made pastry.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>The pastry</h2><p>I’VE never baked with pre-made pastry before, let alone made my own from scratch, so this was a daunting task.</p><p>I immediately felt like it was going disastrously wrong while mixing the butter and lard with the flour and salt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/568150-sun-sun-features-coronation-810898460.jpg><p>The recipe says to rub the ingredients together, “using your fingertips until you get a sandy texture, like bread-crumbs”.</p><p>This seemed to take ages for me, and I don’t actually know if I ever achieved the right texture, as I grew impatient quite quickly.</p><p>While the dough was still quite moist, I decided to head to the next step and poured in the milk.</p><p>I mixed it all together, covered the bowl with cling film and put it in the fridge to rest.</p><p>While the recipe states it should be left for 30 to 45 minutes, I opted for just over half an hour, not actually really knowing what consistency the dough was meant to be forming.</p><p>Once I removed the dough from the fridge and rolled it out I could tell I’d had a nightmare.</p><p>I laid the pastry in the tin and winced as it got thinner and thinner.</p><p>I knew I was going to have issues later in the baking process, but I put it back in the fridge again for another half an hour, as instructed.</p><p>Luckily, I’d planned for this and had my ready-made shortcrust pastry on hand to save the day.</p><p>Using the ready-made pastry, which I picked up from <a href=#>Aldi</a> for £1.09, I could just skip all the previous steps, including more than an hour of waiting time, and line a second tin.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Pastry – you need:</h3></p><p>125g of plain flour<br>Pinch of salt<br>25g of diced cold<br>butter<br>25g of lard<br>Two tablespoons<br>of milk<br>OR 250g block of ready-made shortcrust pastry</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>The filling</h2><p>WHILE waiting for the dough to set I made the filling for both quiches — which I’m very happy to say was the easiest part.</p><p>It simply required beating the eggs, milk, double cream and tarragon together and seasoning it all with some salt and pepper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/568150-sun-sun-features-coronation-810898516.jpg><p>I also grated my Cheddar cheese at this point, ready to go into the pastry as well.</p><p>The spinach and broad beans needed cooking, too, so I put the beans in the microwave for four minutes and fried the spinach to wilt it slightly.</p><p>I was sure this part couldn’t go wrong — and it didn’t.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Filling – you need:</h3></p><p>125ml of milk<br>175ml of double cream<br>Two medium-sized eggs<br>One tablespoon of chopped tarragon<br>Salt and pepper<br>100g of grated Cheddar cheese<br>180g of cooked spinach, slightly chopped<br>60g of cooked broad beans<br>20cm flan tin</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Blind baking</h2><p>I’VE heard the term “blind baking” from <a href=#>Paul Hollywood</a> and Prue Leith many a time on the <a href=#>Great British Bake Off</a> but never quite knew what it was.</p><p>Now I do — it’s when you bake the pastry without the filling — and it turns out you can do it without weighted and heat-conducting baking beans, which are usually used in the process and which I didn’t have.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/568150-sun-sun-features-coronation-810898546.jpg><p>I lined both tins with greaseproof paper.</p><p>Then, after a quick Google search of alternatives to baking beans, I poured uncooked rice into both and popped them into the oven at 190C.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Filling the quiche</h2><p>AS I took both dishes out of the oven and removed the baking paper and rice it was extremely clear that I’d massively failed on my own pastry attempt.</p><p>It was already slightly burnt at the top and had a soggy bottom that <a href=#>Mary Berry</a> would be far from happy with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/568150-sun-sun-features-coronation-810898500.jpg><p>Meanwhile, the ready-made pastry was looking good.</p><p>I filled both with equal amounts of the filling — putting in the cheese, then broad beans, then spinach and more cheese — before putting them back into the oven again for another 25 minutes at 160C.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Method</h2><p>Sieve the flour and salt into a bowl, add the fats and rub together using fingertips until you get a sandy texture, like breadcrumbs.</p><p>Gradually pour in the milk and bring the ingredients together in a dough.</p><p>Cover the bowl, put it in the fridge and let it rest for 30 to 45 minutes.</p><p>Lightly flour your work surface then remove the pastry and roll it out a little bit larger than your flan tin.</p><p>Line the tin with the pastry – don’t tear it.</p><p>Put this back in the fridge for another 30 minutes to set.</p><p>Preheat the oven to 190C.</p><p>Line the pastry case with greaseproof paper, add baking beans and then bake for 15 minutes.</p><p>Remove both the paper and the baking beans.</p><p>Reduce the oven to 160C.</p><p>Beat together the eggs, milk, cream, herbs and seasoning.</p><p>Scatter half of the grated cheese into the base, then place the chopped spinach, beans and herbs on top.</p><p>Pour in the liquid mixture.</p><p>Gently stir the mixture to make sure it is evenly dispersed in the pastry, but be careful not to damage it.</p><p>Sprinkle the second half of the cheese on top, then place in the oven and bake for 25 minutes.</p><p>Bake until it is set and lightly golden.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>The result</h2><p>ON opening the oven I immediately saw how burnt the crusts on the quiche I’d made from scratch were.</p><p>It looked like it was going to be impossible to get it out of the tin unharmed — and it was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/568150-sun-sun-features-coronation-810898599.jpg><p>The quiche was so burnt it was stuck to the tin, and I had to force it out in a few different parts, leaving it looking like a big mushy mess on my plate.</p><p>On the other hand, the pre-made pastry quiche looked almost as perfectly golden as the picture of the official Coronation Quiche.</p><p>I got it out of the tin with ease and couldn’t actually believe I’d made a quiche.</p><p>And when it came to the taste...both were excellent, even if I do say so myself.</p><p>If you love cheese and spinach, like I do, you’re in luck.</p><p>Meanwhile, the tarragon adds that little extra something.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>If you opt for the ready-made pastry the Coronation Quiche is a relatively easy dish to make.</p><p>And it will be perfect at any street party or afternoon tea to celebrate the <a href=#>crowning of our King.</a></p><p class=postsid
