Kody was raised in Wyoming by <strong>Genielle Brown</strong> and <strong>William Brown</strong>, who was also a polygamist and had three wives.&nbsp;“Every polygamous man has thought to himself how wonderful [monogamy] might be,” Kody told&nbsp;Us Weekly in February 2021. “You know, ‘The grass is greener.’ … But every family in polygamy is very different.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Find out more below about Kody’s four wives — both past and present — plus his 18 respective children — both biological and adopted! — he shares with the women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kody-Brown-Children-ss-post-21.jpg><h2>Meri Brown</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Meri</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Brown</strong></a>, 52, was Kody’s first wife, as the two wed April 21, 1990. The couple originally met through Meri’s sister in 1989 and quickly became engaged and married the following year, when Kody was 21 and Meri 19. They were legally married until 2014 when they got divorced so Kody could marry his fourth wife, <strong>Robyn</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Although the pair have been together for quite a long time, in February of last year, he told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;that their relationship&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had been “in a very dark place”</a> for some time. “It’s been more about trying to get ourselves out of this hole that we dug ourselves into,” he explained. “I hope time heals things. I hope that some communication heals things. It’s been a long time and it’s been very difficult.” Meri also vented in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 2021 Instagram post</a> about “being manipulated” by her husband.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 17 trailer,</a>&nbsp;Meri admits she’s not&nbsp;“really sure we have a family anymore,” after&nbsp;<strong>Christine Brown&nbsp;</strong>leaves the polygamous family.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Meri and Kody share one child together,&nbsp;<strong>Leon.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Leon Brown</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Born July, 29 1995, the pair’s eldest child&nbsp;Leon <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>came out as transgender</a> in June 2022.&nbsp; Originally named <strong>Mariah, </strong>Leon announced their new name in an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post, where they also shared that they use they/them pronouns. “I’m finally ready to share my favorite self with the world. and that self is incredibly genderqueer, trans, and unapologetic,” they wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Leon attended Westminster College until 2013 and then Loyola University where she studied social work. Prior to coming out as trans, they came out as a lesbian in 2017 and has since been in a relationship with <strong>Audrey Kriss</strong>. The pair were engaged in 2019. Back in 2017, after Leon came out, dad Kody admitted he was “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>still in a state of processing</a>” the announcement, considering the beliefs around homosexuality in the Mormon church.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Most recently, their sibling,&nbsp;<strong>Gwendlyn Brown</strong>, spoke about Leon’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>place in the family</a> during a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>YouTube video</a> on Feb. 19, 2023. “Leon has been, since childhood, kind of the odd one out in the family because they had no siblings from their mom [Meri] to really get along with,” Gwendlyn said in response to a fan question. Given that Leon also came out as&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>transgender</a>, their sibling highlighted that they are “separating themselves” from the family. “It’s not that they’re not fitting in, it’s that they have chosen to go to people who they can trust,” she added. “They’ve found a safer community for themselves.”</p><h2>Janelle Brown</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Meri actually introduced&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Janelle Brown</strong></a>,&nbsp;53, to Kody in the early ’90s and they were “spiritually married” in 1993. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Janelle told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;she thought there’d be more “camaraderie” due to their close proximity during the crisis.&nbsp;“I really think it would have been easier to deal with being quarantined if we were all under one roof because we’re having to be so separate,” she said at the time, noting it would be “easier” for them all if they weren’t taking care of “separate households.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Kody and Janelle face marital struggles in season 17 of the reality series. “I don’t think you and I know how to be real about things with each other,” Kody says to Janelle, who admits that Kody is “no longer acting as my husband here.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>The couple share six children: sons <strong>Logan</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Hunter</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Robert</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Gabriel</strong>, and daughters&nbsp;<strong>Maddie</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Savannah</strong>.</p><h2>Logan Taylor</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>The oldest of Kody’s children overall, Logan, was born May 21, 1994.
