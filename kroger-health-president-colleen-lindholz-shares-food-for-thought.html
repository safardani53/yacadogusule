People are very busy, and our platform simplifies information for our customers and helps them make better food choices, as well as saving them time and money.</p><p><strong>Us: How does the OptUp app work?</strong><br><strong>CL:</strong> The OptUp app is a true game changer be-cause it makes it easier for people to make healthier food choices. Basically, the way it works is it evaluates what you put in your cart. It looks at the history [of your purchases] and recommends products that are better for you.</p><p><strong>Us: Kroger’s inaugural Wellness Your Way Festival was a huge success this past October. Can you tell Us anything about this year’s festival?</strong><br>CL: We’re looking to expand. This year, we want to have two festivals, Cincinnati and Denver, versus just one. And then at Kroger, one of our goals is to have the healthiest workforce in America. So we are going to get our own associates involved more this year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Us: How does the festival reflect Kroger’s vision?</strong><br><strong>CL:</strong> Our mission statement says that we’re going to simplify healthcare by creating solutions that combine health, wellness and nutrition, connecting with the customers on a personal and emotional level. We feel the festival embodies our purpose, vision, mission and really everything that we’re trying to do as a grocer across the country.</p><p>With reporting by Marc Lupo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGakqp%2BcsrN5x56YpayYYr2zsdKim56mpGKwsLjLnpynZZyeu6W0zqWxZquYlr%2Bmv4yfpqicXZu8s3nToaaun5ipfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
