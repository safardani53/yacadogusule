She gave fans a behind-the-scenes look at his Lollapalooza Paris performance at the Hippodrome de Longchamp in a series of Snapchat videos.</p><p>The private pair recently opened up about their relationship in a joint interview for GQ’s August cover story. Jenner told the publication that it’s “normal” for the two to get <a href=#>“in a little fight”</a> now and then.</p><p>“When we fight, it’s usually just because we’ve been away from each other for too long and we didn’t see each other for, like, two weeks,” she said. “And we have Stormi now, and I can’t travel with her. She’s too young.

If he has events or something, I won’t come. Because I want him to do his own thing, I want him to be him. I don’t want it to be Kylie and Trav. If people don’t see us together, that’s OK with me, because we just do our own thing.”</p><p>Scott and Jenner began dating in April 2017 and welcomed their first child together in February 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksZyesm62xKelnqpdlruledOrmK%2Bho2LApLvTrWScrZSZuaZ5yKdkqZyRYrOquMuem2aomZh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
