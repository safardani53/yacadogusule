And she probably really is. Ever since she was born he was always out of town," added Messer.</p><p>Later in the podcast, Leah stated that she doesn’t speak to Jeremy very often herself, stating for the record:</p><p>“Jeremy and I’s communication has slimmed to where I think it should be, as far as my boundaries being respected and nothing further."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Messer and Calvert had a complicated history for awhile.</p><p>They were up. They were down. They were fighting. They were sleeping with each other.</p><p>At last check, however, they <a href=#>stopped getting it on back in late 2019</a> and haven’t really been on great terms since then.</p><p>This may be best for Leah and Jeremy themselves, but it’s not an ideal situation for young Addie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Messer, meanwhile, claims her kids are ready to see her with a new man.</p><p>"You do need to go on a date soon, you need to actually find someone nice,"&nbsp;Aleeah told her parent on this week’s Teen Mom 2 episode.</p><p>Leah didn’t really argue, but later said in a confessional:</p><p>"I want to be physically, mentally 100% before I add anyone else to me life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She added that she hopes she show them an "example of a healthy relationship" so they "can hopefully to do it differently than what I did," which was an indirect shot at Jeremy.</p><p>Could that flame ever be rekindled, though?</p><p>"This will NEVER happen!" Leah told a follower who recently asked if she’d get back together with Calvert.</p><p>"We all get along very well and put our daughter’s best interest first," she added of Jeremy and also ex Corey Simms, concluding:</p><p>"I prefer to keep it that way. I will always wish them the best in life."</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WEcLjEmp9mpZWowKa%2BjKOcq52drnqkrcuvnKusXZ7Abq2MraatmZxisaatw5ucmqxdma6lew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
