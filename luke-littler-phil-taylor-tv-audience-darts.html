He’s got a lovely, natural throw.</p><p>“There is nothing mechanical or forced about it. Lovely, fluid action, lovely straight follow-through.</p><p>“Luke has the style of John Lowe and the mentality of Eric Bristow – put those two together and you’ve got one hell of a player.</p><p>“I have loved the way he doesn’t panic if he loses a couple of legs.</p><p>“He has the composure, and the mental toughness, to come back and win the next three, and you can’t coach that sort of mentality in a 16-year-old.</p><p>“He makes the game exciting, he makes you turn over and watch the darts even if your favourite soap opera or bake-off programme is on the other channel.”</p><p>Littler, who was born and bred in Warrington, grew up idolising Taylor and has loved hearing the words of advice and encouragement from his hero at various points during this fairy tale run.</p><p>Six months after leaving school, he has become the most famous teenager in the world.</p><p>Luke The Nuke is set to be a wealthy young man if he stays on the straight and narrow throughout the rest of his teen years.</p><p>That is highly likely given that he is a grounded kid, who likes nothing more than throwing darts at home and playing on his Xbox.</p><p>His life has changed forever but Taylor, whose first world title came at Lakeside aged 29 in 1990, says it is important that the Boy Wonder is protected at all costs.</p><p>Taylor said: “Apart from being a fantastic darts player, he is a smashing lad. No airs or graces about him, feet on the ground.</p><p>“Don’t just look at the way he has played darts at the World Championship – look how well he has dealt with all the attention.</p><p>“He’s a lovely kid, a great credit to his parents, and he has the right people around him.</p><p>“His life is going to change from now on because he won’t just be able to stay at home for a few days with nobody knowing who he is.</p><p>“Everyone is going to want a piece of him now and his management will have to protect him from the people who consider him public property.</p><p>“I always said ‘yes’ to Barry Hearn when he wanted me to jump on a plane to South Africa, China or wherever.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“These places were 12 hours away by air, not just round the corner – although it sounds great, sometimes it left me shattered afterwards.</p><p>“But for now, Luke is lucky because he’s so young and he will enjoy all the adventures in front of him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fpNpZ3JrX6HCrLGMpaCtrJyav268x6KjZqyRrrmwvoytrWaZpZm2prrCnmSdmaKpwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
