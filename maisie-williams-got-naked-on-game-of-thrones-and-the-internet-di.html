I said I had not thought of her that way since she single-handedly massacred all of House Frey. Which they deserved."</p><p>Both Arya and Maisie also enjoyed a great deal of support across the internet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The always-brilliant folks at Bossip sounded off on the matter, as did Missandei actress Nathalie Emmanuel</p><p>"@Maisie_Williams and Arya having agency over her own sexuality like all women should literally gave me liiiifeee," Emmanuel tweeted.</p><p>But the best reaction of the night likely belongs to Sophie Turner, who’s spent the better part of the past decade portraying Maisie’s onscreen sister, Sansa Stark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"In honor of Easter, I guess Game Of Thrones wanted the storyline to have a little Easter bunny hop, hop, hopping into that p–sy," Sansa told the camera.</p><p>We love it.</p><p>A girl has no V-card, and we’re sure Maisie is deeply proud of her empowering scene.</p><p>Of course, according to horror movie rules, Arya is now that much more likely to get iced in the battle with the White Walkers, but that’s a conversation for next week.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Game of Thrones: Who’s About to Die!?
