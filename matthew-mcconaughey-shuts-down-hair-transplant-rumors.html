Rewind to the ‘90s, and the 52-year-old actor was struggling with a “baseball-sized bald spot.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>So, how did he get his head of hair back to its former glory? Contrary to some rumors, the Gold Rush actor insisted there was no hair transplant involved.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“You can go back and look at things like the Wedding Planner and those things. I mean, you’ll see, I was losing hair,” he said in an interview with LADBible. “I had silver dollar back here, so I shaved it off.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The secret to turning his buzz cut into a shiny mane is apparently thanks to a handy dandy cream, which he previously revealed on a 2017 episode of Live with Kelly and Ryan is called Renigex. He rubs the formula on his scalp “once a day for ten minutes.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>According to the brand’s website, the cream does not promote hair growth, but rather prevents “hair thinning and thickens your hair” with a drug-free, personalized treatment. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I was fully committed to it. No Propecia [a prescription drug], no nothing. It was just manual labor,” the Dallas Buyers Club actor explained in his recent interview. “All I can tell you is it came back. I have more hair now than I had in 1999.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>And he has no plans on stopping the regimen anytime soon. “The same thing I was rubbing it down with I still do today,” he said. “I’m not gonna quit to see if like, ‘Oh, do I need to do it anymore? I’m not taking that chance.’”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While McConaughey has no shame in his hair growth game, he did take a moment to shut down claims that he’s had hair plugs put in by a doctor.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Apparently, he was recently clued in by a Beverly Hills surgeon that a doctor at an annual hair transplant conference has been taking undeserved credit for his hair evolution.</p><p class=p1>“He goes, ‘Can I just look at your hair? Can I just feel and it and see? I said, ‘Yea man,’ and he goes, ‘You don’t have transplants!<span class=Apple-converted-space> I </span>said, ‘That’s what I said, of course I don’t.’ He goes, ‘I can’t wait to bust this guy’s nut next year when he raises his hand.’”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6KutcDHnq5mpZOYvK%2Bt1KCfnrFdqLW2wNJmm6ivnmK1orXRZqurmZ6ova2tza1kq62dpL%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
