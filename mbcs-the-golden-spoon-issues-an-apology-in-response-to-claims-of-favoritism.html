However, actor Son Woo-Hyun was the focus of these films, which enraged fans who accused MBC of showing bias toward the actor.</p><p>Fans have noted MBC’s preference for Son Woo-hyun over the starring actors, prompting them to accuse the broadcasting organization of bias earlier.&nbsp;MBC has now issued an apology, requesting forgiveness from the supporters. They said that The Golden Spoon has the greatest cast and staff, as well as a fantastic atmosphere that elevates supporting performers to key roles.</p><p>“We regret for causing inconvenience to the performers and fans who like our program as a result of this situation.”</p><h2>MBC recognizes and apologizes to fans for its treatment of Son Woo-hyun in The Golden Spoon.</h2><p>MBC released an apology in which they praised the amicable atmosphere on the set of The Golden Spoon while apologizing to upset fans. Their public apologies stated:</p><p>“Like the idols that they are, key actors Yook Sungjae, Jung Chaeyeon, and Yeonwoo all take the lead and promote the project without hesitation.” It’s gotten to the point where they take charge and look after Lee Jong Won and Son Woo Hyun, who aren’t as comfortable with making-of films.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Golden-Spoon-1.jpg alt="The Golden Spoon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Previously, MBC aired a making-of video aimed towards Yook Sung-jae, as the title suggests. However, the BtoB singer had few film appearances, while his co-star Son Woo-hyun was far more apparent.&nbsp;Fans also noted that MBC added an extraordinary quantity of images of Son Woo-hyun on the show’s community website, in addition to the video parts. One fan pointed out that one behind-the-scenes video had 9-10 photographs of Son Woo-hyun but just a few of shots of Yook Sung-jae.</p><p>The Golden Spoon, based on the same-named webtoon, recounts the story of a student born into a poor household who one day discovers a golden spoon that enables him to swap his life for the life of his affluent best friend. Life-changing events follow him following his no-brainer choice, but he only has three chances before settling into his new life forever.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Golden-Spoon-2.jpg alt="The Golden Spoon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The K-drama premiered on MBC on September 23, 2022, and is nearing its conclusion. The show, which is available internationally on Disney+, has received great reviews from fans so far, and the cast has been praised for their genuine approach to their crazy characters.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikm5ujYsGpsYygpqWclaN6tLzOqKVmoaOowqa%2FjJqlZpmgpLmws9hmoKdloprAsbvNrJxmrJ9isK2tyKaqZqeWYrOiws6roK2ho6J8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
