The dessert was topped with a yellow candle and <a href=#>decorated with an image of Carter</a> holding his baby boy.</p><p>“Have to be strong for our son,” she captioned a subsequent Instagram Story of herself holding balloons after Prince’s bash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Aaron-Carter-Ex-Fiancee-Melanie-Martin-Celebrates-Son-Prince-1st-Birthday-With-Rare-Photos-3.jpg><p>The somber celebration came less than one month after <a href=#>the “I Want Candy” artist was found dead</a> in his California home on November 5. He was 34 years old.</p><p>Martin has been <a href=#>candid about her grief</a> in the weeks since Carter’s death. “It happened so fast and I’m still in shock that I will never see his face again,” she exclusively told Us Weekly on November 7, noting that she was with Prince when Carter was discovered. “<a href=#>Aaron was a wonderful man</a> and he really loved to take care of his family. He never gave up on me. We might have had arguments and breakups, but we really could not live without each other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Aaron-Carter-Ex-Fiancee-Melanie-Martin-Celebrates-Son-Prince-1st-Birthday-With-Rare-Photos-2.jpg><p>The twosome began dating in early 2020 and got engaged that June. Shortly after <a href=#>welcoming their baby</a> in November 2021, <a href=#>Carter announced</a> that the couple had called it quits. They briefly reconciled before splitting once again in February, but <a href=#>the on-off duo seemed to be on good terms</a>.</p><p>“Aaron really treated me like an actual princess,” Martin told Us this month. “A lot of people saw the ‘internet side’ of Aaron, and I feel like I did get to see the real side of Aaron or I wouldn’t have fallen in love with him for three years.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added: “I was really looking forward to getting married and <a href=#>having more children with him</a>. I feel like we were very close and I was looking forward to spending the holidays with my family again. I am beyond devastated waiting until I can meet my wonderful soulmate again. We never gave up on our love and I feel like we both couldn’t live without each other.”</p><p>In the wake of his death, <a href=#>the Dancing With the Stars alum</a> was cremated. According to a death certificate obtained by TMZ, the musician’s twin sister,<a href=#><strong> Angel Carter</strong></a>, will <a href=#>keep his ashes in her possession</a> until the family decides on a final resting place. The legal document did not list Aaron’s cause of death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnZyWu6qxjKaYq6yZo3qkscuemauZpJrAbr%2FOp6pmmpmnwamwwLJkmp6kmr9urcCrpqdlk5a%2FtbHRrGSdnZGptXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
