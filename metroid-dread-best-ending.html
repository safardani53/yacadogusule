Samus is finally able to defeat Raven Beak when she manages to unlock all of her Metroid abilities, draining his energies. When Raven Beak is then attacked by an X parasite, she uses her fully transformed suit to defeat him and run to her ship.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo</span></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p>But once our hero reaches her ship, she's informed that her Metroid Suit would drain the power of her ship.
