Although her most publicized relationships have been with famous men like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Liam Hemsworth</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Nick Jonas</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Cody Simpson</a>, Cyrus — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>who identifies as queer</a> — has never shied from expressing her attraction to women. In fact, she's spoken at length about her pansexuality in various candid interviews throughout her career — and has even been photographed more than once during moments of intense PDA with famous women.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In July 2015, Cyrus was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spotted kissing a former Victoria’s Secret Angel</a>, and weeks before <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>ending her marriage to Hemsworth</a>, the "Jaded" hitmaker was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>photographed in Italy kissing</a> Brody Jenner's ex-wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Kaitlynn Carter</a>. (Not to mention <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Cyrus' first kiss</a> was with a girl in middle school.)<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since December 2021, Cyrus has been dating drummer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Maxx Morando</a>, whom she recounted meeting on a blind date in a May 2023 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>interview with British Vogue</a>.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From opening up about heterosexual and queer love to expressing her sexual desires with her family, here is everything Cyrus has said about non-conforming love.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Miley Cyrus.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>REX/Shutterstock</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-told-her-mom-at-14-i-admire-women-in-a-different-way></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She told her mom at 14: "I admire women in a different way"</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Disney Channel</a> star recalled a conversation with her mother, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Tish Cyrus</a>, about her sexuality at age 14. "I remember telling her I admire women in a different way. And she asked me what that meant. And I said, 'I love them. I love them like I love boys.' And it was so hard for her to understand," Miley told Paper magazine in June 2015.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She didn't want me to be judged, and she didn't want me to go to hell. But she believes in me more than she believes in any God. I just asked for her to accept me. And she has," she continued, later adding, "I don't relate to being boy or girl, and I don't have to have my partner relate to boy or girl."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, Cyrus came out as pansexual; that same year, she dated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Patrick Schwarzenegger</a> for five months before <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>calling it quits</a>. Then, shortly after they broke up, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Cyrus was seen kissing model Stella Maxwell</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Billy Ray, Tish and Miley Cyrus.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>John Shearer/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My whole life, I didn't understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word ‘bisexual,’ because that's even putting me in a box. I don't ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl," Cyrus <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Variety</a> in October 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My first relationship in my life was with a chick. I grew up in a very religious Southern family. … Once I understood my gender more, which was unassigned, then I understood my sexuality more. I was like, 'Oh — that's why I don't feel straight and I don't feel gay. It's because I'm not,'" she explained.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-says-being-a-lesbian-is-a-compliment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She says being a lesbian "is a compliment"</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of her earliest quotes about her sexuality came in 2013, when she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told the Toronto Sun</a>: "Everyone said I was a lesbian but I'm like, ‘Being a lesbian isn't a bad thing. So if you think I look like I'm a lesbian, I'm not offended. You can call me much worse.’ Being a lesbian is a compliment more than what else they call me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Similarly, Cyrus further revealed in her 2015 Paper interview about coming into her own sexuality: "I am literally open to every single thing that is consenting and doesn't involve an animal and everyone is of age. Everything that's legal, I'm down with. Yo, I'm down with any adult — anyone over the age of 18 who is down to love me."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Miley Cyrus.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>VH1</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pride Month</a> in 2015, the star encouraged her fans to "just be whatever you want to be,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>telling TIME</a>: "I don't associate men and protection necessarily. I think that's what's given me the openness of sexuality. Not that my dad wasn't an awesome protector, but I trust my mom to save me. She's the prince. I never had that fairy tale."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cyrus also shared how she felt an "overly macho energy" that she didn't like when she would be around certain men. "That made me feel like I had to be a femme-bot, which I'm not. And then when I was with a girl, I felt like, 'Oh s---, she's going to need someone to protect her, so I'm going to need to have this macho energy.' And that didn't feel right either," she said, later adding: "I thought, 'I'm not living like this.' … If I end up in a straight relationship, that's fine — but I'm not going to be with f------ slob guys."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rich Polk/Getty Images for Disney</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-believes-in-redefining-what-queer-love-looks-like></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She believes in "redefining" what queer love looks like</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cyrus <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told the Associated Press</a> in 2015 that not all her past relationships were "straight, heterosexual" ones. Though she did not further specify what she meant at the time, the actress elaborated on her romantic preferences years later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the months after her December 2018 wedding to Hemsworth, Cyrus made it clear on multiple occasions that, although she was in a heterosexual relationship, she still identifies as queer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The reason that people get married sometimes can be old-fashioned, but I think <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the reason we got married isn't old-fashioned</a> — I actually think it's kind of New Age," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>told Vanity Fair</a> for its March 2019 cover story. "We're redefining, to be f------ frank, what it looks like for someone that's a queer person like myself to be in a hetero relationship."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cyrus continued: "What I preach is: People fall in love with people, not gender, not looks, not whatever. What I'm in love with exists on almost a spiritual level. It has nothing to do with sexuality. Relationships and partnerships in a new generation — I don't think they have so much to do with sexuality or gender. Sex is actually a small part, and gender is a very small, almost irrelevant part of relationships."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though she admitted marriage was "kind of out of character for me," Cyrus still made her stance clear: "Like, who gives a f--- if he's a guy, if I'm a girl, or if he was a woman — who gives a f---? We really are stronger together. One is the loneliest number."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Miley Cyrus attends the 90th Academy Awards.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/REX/Shutterstock</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-doesnt-fit-into-a-stereotypical-wife-role></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She doesn't "fit into a stereotypical wife role"</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In July 2019, Cyrus <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>opened up to Elle</a>. "I think it's very confusing to people that I'm married. But my relationship is unique," Cyrus said of her and Hemsworth at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't know that I would ever publicly allow people in there because it's so complex, and modern, and new that I don't think we're in a place where people would get it," she continued. "I mean, do people really think that I'm at home in a f------ apron cooking dinner? I'm in a hetero relationship, but I still am very sexually attracted to women."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cyrus added: "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>People become vegetarian</a> for health reasons, but bacon is still f------ good, and I know that. I made a partner decision. This is the person I feel has my back the most. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>I definitely don't fit into a stereotypical wife role</a>.
