You see, the mom was chopping her daughter's hair off as a way to discipline her.</p><p>She took to the camera to explain that her daughter ‚Äúthinks it‚Äôs more important to be pretty than educated, more important to be a follower than a leader.‚Äù And while the mother filming the TikTok noted that she's "not a parent who likes to use physical discipline," she did do quite a number on her daughter's tresses.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>As she took out her scissors to begin chopping, the teen objected ‚Äî however, there was no going back for this mama.</p><p>"You had your warning, you had your chance. I told you to listen, I told you to stop disobeying my rules," the mom said as she rotated around her daughter's head, snipping entire braids off.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I told you being cute ain‚Äôt s--t if you have no education. I told you to stop disobeying me, I told you to listen and do as you‚Äôre supposed to, I told you to do good in school, I told you to do your daily routine,‚Äù the mom continued. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sadly mistaken because you thought being pretty was so much better than being educated or listening to your mom, right," she said as she finished up.</p><p>Then she showed off her daughter's remaining hair to the camera and said, "this is what happens when you don't listen to your mom."</p><p>But the story didn't just end right there.

Maybe their daughters are living the way they couldn‚Äôt or weren‚Äôt allowed to live. You can definitely tell that these mothers are lashing out at their daughters.
