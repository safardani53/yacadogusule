Monroe seems heavily influenced by Barrett if the video comparisons are any clue.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The TikToker wears the same outfits as Barrett and has the same hairstyle.&nbsp;For example, in one video, Barrett was wearing a black biker short set with her hair in double braids. Likewise, Monroe&nbsp;has a video where she is wearing the same outfit and hairstyle.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In other videos, Monroe also allegedly copied Barrett’s poses, lip-syncing facial expressions, and the overall vibe and aesthetic of her TikToks. In one instance, fans noticed Monroe copying the singer’s TikTok live video where her hairstylist was&nbsp;curling her hair.&nbsp;</p><p>It could be a coincidence, but fans believe Monroe is copying Barrett.&nbsp;After months of being called out a copycat,&nbsp;Monroe has finally addressed the issue.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kendall Monroe Insists She Is Not Nessa Barrett's Copycat</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On September 1, 2022, Monroe uploaded a TikTok video titled “Speaking the truth.” She tagged the video as mental health matters and depression awareness.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She started the video by apologizing to Barrett, claiming she had not meant to make the singer uncomfortable over the past couple of months.&nbsp;She clarified she was neither&nbsp;obsessed with the ‘La Die Die’ singer nor wanted to be like her and added she supported anti-bullying, positivity, and kindness.</p><p>According to Monroe, she started her TikTok account in late May, based on an experiment to understand how much hate there was in the world of social media.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Kendall Monroe responds to haters calling her Nessa Barrett's copycat.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“Even though I don’t read the 1000s of hate comments on my page daily, every once in a while, I would read and try to comprehend how somebody can be so hateful towards a person who they never met, This does not just happen to me and actually happens to all creators,” said Monroe.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She added that these keyboard warriors did not understand how much their words impacted the victims’ mental health.&nbsp;Monroe ended the video by asking people to stop spending their energy on posting hateful comments.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Nessa Barrett Responds to Kendall Monroe</h2><p>Shortly after, Barrett commented on Monroe’s video.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The comment has already been deleted, but it was screengrabbed by tiktokinsiders.&nbsp;Her response suggested she was not buying Monroe’s apology or explanations.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Monroe has not responded to Barrett’s comments and instead uploaded a new video teasing a snippet of her first single. She had recorded her laptop with a screensaver of&nbsp;a black heart and the words “bad to me” written on top of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, in the comments section, netizens accused her of copying Barrett again.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“I thought this was an experiment, bestie.&nbsp;Is the experiment not over?” commented a user. Another user commented, “why is the heart like in the exact shape of Coop’s necklace that Ness has?”</p><p>Some even noticed that the fonts she used looked exactly like the ones Barrett used for her ‘Counting Crimes’ single.&nbsp;Many netizens were asking Barrett to sue the "copycat,"&nbsp;but it remains to be seen how Barrett will respond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKaVqMCiecGaqaudpKl6pLvPspqarF2gsq%2BwwKWjZqWfo7%2BwsY2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
