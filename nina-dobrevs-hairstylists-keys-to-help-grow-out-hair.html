Even if you are only taking off a 1/2 an inch, do it! (And yes, a trim is the same price as a haircut, 1 inch or 4 inches, we still do the same sectioning, don’t be cheap, take care of your hair that is the frame to your face.) 2) Protect and Nourish it on the daily! I mean this with my whole heart ❤️, @incommon #magicmyst is a daily treatment. 🙌🏼 Every single person can benefit and feel a difference instantly. Magic Myst isn’t just a “leave in detangler” in addition to that, it’s packs a punch worth of vitamins, adds the perfect amount of shine, controls frizz, defines curls, smoothes your blowout, protects from heat and sun, and strengthens the cuticle. You wouldn’t go a day with out your face lotion , so why go a day without your hair vitamins? Use it wet or dry. Just use it. Trust Me. Why? Because healthy hair has no competition, Right Neens? Xx</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Riawna Capri | Hairstylist</a> (@riawna) on Mar 13, 2019 at 11:26pm PDT</p><p>She continues to note that a trim does, in fact, cost the same as a full cut but she urges people to thing of it as a necessary expense, advising that hair “Is the frame to your face.”</p><p>Her other must-do: “Protect and Nourish it on the daily,” the second part of the caption reads. “I mean this with my whole heart.”</p><p>She points out how important vitamins are for hair just like they are for skin. But she doesn’t just leave you high and dry to figure out where to get these nutrients, she recommends a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">treatment</a> she wears by:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> In Common Magic Myst Universal Elixir</a>. She says it isn’t just a detangler but that it’s vitamin-filled formula that also works to add shine, control frizz, define curls, smooth blowouts, protect against heat and UV rays and strengthens hairs’ cuticles. Now that’s one impressive multitasking product.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Use it wet or dry. Just use it,” she concludes the post with. “Trust Me. Why?
