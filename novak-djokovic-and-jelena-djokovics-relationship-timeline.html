Airplanes were, at the time, something utterly out of our reach. We contrived and devised these plans how to meet, how to make our relationship work.”</p><p>While Jelena relocated to Milan for college, Novak was busy traveling around the world for tournaments. The two eventually moved in together in Monte Carlo after Jelena graduated. After getting engaged in 2023, <a href=#>they tied the knot the following year </a>— days after Novak’s second Wimbledon win — and welcomed their first child, son Stefan, three months later. Daughter Tara arrived in September 2017.</p><p>In June 2022, Novak, <a href=#>who has won a total of 23 Grand Slams</a> throughout his career, gushed about his wife always finding a way to show up and cheer him on.</p><p>“She runs with the wolf,” Novak said of his wife, referring to himself by his nickname, during a Wimbledon on-court interview. “It can be very stressful to run with the wolf. I know that she doesn’t enjoy it at all times. … I love her, she’s my great support.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for Novak and Jelena’s complete relationship timeline:</p><h3><b>2005</b></h3><p>The couple, who were high school sweethearts, met in the early 2000s.

I am so blessed to have him in my life. I couldn’t ask for a better partner than him.”</p><p>Novak, for his part, told the outlet that his bride looked like an “angel” during their nuptials. “I was trying to be present in that moment and memorize it.
