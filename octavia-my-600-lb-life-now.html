Plus, how to follow her on social media.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><p>There's a whole new season of<a href=#> My 600-lb Life </a>premiering on TLC — and Season 7 is following the weight loss journeys of 20 individuals who are determined to get healthier.&nbsp;</p><p>Kicking off the season is Octavia Summar — a woman who has been bed-bound for a year, who finally decides to make the trip to Houston to seek medical treatment from Dr. Younan Nowzaradan.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is the way we've had to cope with life," Octavia explains in a trailer for the TLC series. "We got to change this. We don't have to keep doing what we doing. I want you to fight for you and I want me to fight for me. If we keep on doing the way that we're doing, we're not going to be here."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>However, traveling to Houston is not easy for the Octavia, who has not been outside her apartment in a long time. On the show, EMTs were needed to move Octavia from her bed the van she would be riding in for the trip.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's embarrassing to have all of this just to leave my apartment," she said on the show, "but I'm doing this to make sure this isn't my life. I know I'm fighting for my life but it's hard to be leaving my family"&nbsp;</p><p>There is also an unexpected twist in Octavia's story. She quickly discovers that "her best friend is also her worst enabler." &nbsp;So, Octavia will have to choose between her old habits (and friends) and her new life.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Octavia now?&nbsp;</h2><p>Luckily for fans, Octavia is active on social media, and planning to keep viewers updated on her progress since filming ended. "Thanks everyone for supporting me," she wrote on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> page. "Follow me for updates and photos."&nbsp;</p><p>Along with updates, Octavia also shared some recent selfies, and the brunette beauty looks as though she has slimmed down since appearing on My 600-lb Life.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><p>Most likely, she followed <a href=#>Dr. Now's popular low-carb, low-fat, high-protein diet plan</a>, which requires his patients to limit their caloric intake to roughly 1,200 calories a day.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that Octavia had to give up sugary snacks and drinks, as well as high-carb foods like potatoes (in pretty much any form, be it chips, french fries, or mashed potatoes), rice, pasta, and cereal.</p><p>Plus, Octavia had to deal with Dr. Now's "tough love" — which can sometimes be very hard for patients.&nbsp;</p><p>"It’s a daily challenge to work with some patients that can be self-destructive. My job is not to get aggravated, but to find a way to motivate them to work hard to get to their goals. There are times where I think it’s necessary for some tough love and I have to be stern with them, so I show some of my concern and frustration," Dr. Now told People magazine last year. "Even during those times, my job is to find a way to work with them to get their weight to a healthy place. They are the patient because they need help and it’s my job to help them no matter what."&nbsp;</p><p>Keep it up, Octavia!
