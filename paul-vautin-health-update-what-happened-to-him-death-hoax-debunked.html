Let’s go further into this post to learn more about the Paul Vautin Death Hoax and other pertinent information.</p><h2>What Happened to Paul Vautin? Death Hoax</h2><p>Many individuals have been interested in the Paul Vautin Death Hoax. He is not dead, and this is all a ruse. However, his brother died a few days ago. Geoffrey Vautin, who had Down syndrome, died around 12.30 a.m. Wednesday at a Brisbane care home.&nbsp;Only two days had elapsed since his brother’s statements before his death propelled him into the public glare. Vautin said that his own brother was born with Down syndrome and stated that he would never intentionally mock someone with a handicap.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Paul-Vautin.jpg alt="Paul Vautin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Vautin said his brother will be “sadly missed but always remembered” in a statement supplied by his manager, John Gibbs.</p><p>“I’m too upset, and my family is in mourning, to say anything else,” he said. I’d appreciate it if you could give my family some space.</p><p>With 2GB broadcaster Ray Hadley revealing that insulting the handicapped was often an intentional purpose of the program, Vautin and The Footy program have had a terrible week.&nbsp;Hadley stated that “Street Talk” staff members were routinely dispatched in search of “nuffies”; Nine has rejected this assertion.&nbsp;Hadley went on to say, “They look around for homeless people, abandoned people, alcoholics, and people who look different.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Paul-Vautin-2.jpg alt="Paul Vautin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Paul Vautin Health Update 2023</h2><p>Paul ‘Fatty’ Vautin, a Manly icon, has revealed that he was diagnosed with cancer after visiting the doctor with a rash on his face.&nbsp;Vautin, who works for Channel 9 and missed the network’s coverage of the State of Origin series, has expressed his astonishment at being ill. Vautin was unavailable to cover this week’s State of Origin due to sickness, in which Queensland pulled off one of the greatest shocks since “Fatty’s Nevilles.”&nbsp;Following his surprise diagnosis, he advises Australians to take better care of their skin and get any lumps or bumps evaluated by a doctor.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>football commentator</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Paul Vautin</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmq2cYsOiwdOipWaglZa5tbSMrqedmaSaeri0wK1koZmgpbKvscNmq6hlmJ66brDEmquhZZikrrl5w56ZrqabmrFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
