And, you know, I guess I’m a little bit cut or whatever,” the <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> star, 27, quipped during an interview on <a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> on Tuesday, April 6. “So, he came up to me and he was like, ‘What do you do [to work out]?’ And I didn’t want to be rude and say, ‘I just still have metabolism. I’m not in my mid-50s.’ I just wake up like this.”</p><p>Davidson came up with a faux gym routine to make the 30 Rock alum, 63, “feel better” about their different body types. “I said, ‘Oh man, I do 100 pushups and 100 situps every day,'” the King of Staten Island star recalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pete-Davidson-Is-the-Reason-Alec-Baldwin-Dropped-100-Lbs.jpg><p>Baldwin took the suggestion to heart, and when he nabbed a recurring role on SNL as former president <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>, Davidson could see the results.</p><p>“Every time I’d run into him in the hall, he’d be like, ‘100 a day!'” the Set It Up actor said. “And he started to do it and he lost, like, 100 pounds. And he says it’s all because of me.”</p><p>The Guy Code alum is no stranger to making self-deprecating comments about himself in his comedy. In November 2020, Davidson <a href=#>poked fun at his “modest bulge.”</a> Two years earlier, his now-ex-fiancée, <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>, told a fan that his manhood was “like 10 inches” long.</p><p>“I don’t like that she talked all that s–t for my penis,” Davidson joked in his Netflix comedy special, <a href=#>Alive From New York</a>, which hit the streaming platform in February 2020. “Everything is huge to her. Why would she tell everyone that I have a huge penis? So that every girl who sees my d–k for the rest of my life is disappointed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pete-Davidson-Is-the-Reason-Alec-Baldwin-Dropped-100-Lbs-Jimmy-Fallon-Tonight-Show.jpg><p>Us Weekly confirmed in May 2018 that Davidson and Grande, 27, were dating. The Big Time Adolescence actor proposed one month later, but the duo <a href=#>called off their engagemen</a>t in October 2018. The Grammy winner is <a href=#>currently engaged</a> to <a href=#><strong>Dalton Gomez</strong></a>, while Davidson has sparked a series of high-profile romances with <a href=#><strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Margaret Qualley</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kaia Gerber</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, Us exclusively confirmed that the comedian is <a href=#>dating Bridgerton star <strong>Phoebe Dynevor</strong></a> after the pair were <a href=#>spotted together in the U.K.</a> on multiple occasions. The couple are “trying to make it work long distance” while Dynevor, 25, films across the pond.</p><p>“Pete and Phoebe are still going strong despite not being able to physically spend time together,” a source revealed. “They keep in touch over text and FaceTime. Right now, they’re just focused on work. … They’re not looking to rush things.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeYq6kr8idnKeskaG5unnHnqOpnZRirq2xwmaZmqSUrLavecuoqp5lYWV9brjBrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
