So don’t be nervous. It’s going to be incredible.’ It was cool to have that reassurance from her before and … now [she’s like], ‘If you need anything, let me know.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pregnant-Lindsay-Arnold-Shares-Advice-and-Support-From-DWTS-Costars.jpg><p>The Latin dancer, 33, has been “a huge inspiration” for Arnold ahead of her first child’s arrival. She gushed over the way Murgatroyd came back to the ABC show from <a href=#>her son Shai’s 2017 birth</a> “stronger ever,” noting, “It’s been very cool for me to watch her do that and realize just because I’m having a baby doesn’t mean I’m done with what I love to do.”</p><p>As for <a href=#><strong>Artem Chigvintsev</strong></a>, Arnold has had “fun chat[s]” with the dad-to-be, 38, and his fiancée, <a href=#><strong>Nikki Bella</strong></a>, as they await their son.</p><p>“It’s just so cool seeing him become a dad and knowing that his life is about to change in that way,” Arnold explained to Us. “Then being able to talk with Nikki about like, ‘Did you feel this was this normal?’ It’s nice to have that support system around you.”</p><p>The So You Think You Can Dance alum is planning to call <a href=#><strong>Karina Smirnoff</strong></a> soon, saying she’s an “incredible mother” to <a href=#>her son, born in April</a>, and has been in contact with her season 28 partner, Sean Spicer.</p><p>“When I told him, he was like, ‘I’m so happy for you. You’re going to be such an incredible mother,” Arnold told Us. “It was very sweet of him.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She announced in May that she and her husband, <strong>Sam Cusick</strong>, are<a href=#> expecting their first child</a>.
