The Netflix original series, directed by Peter Berg, released its second and third seasons in 2018 and 2019, respectively. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>And going by that same formula,&nbsp;QB1&nbsp;was&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">supposed</a>&nbsp;to have gotten its fourth season in August 2020, but sadly it was delayed due to COVID-19 until further notice.</p><p>So far, the rescheduled release date has not been confirmed. Some fans, however, have&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speculated</a>&nbsp;that the show could have been canceled because of the pandemic. On the contrary, some&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources</a>&nbsp;have predicted that the new season could drop anytime.</p><h2>Cast Of New Season</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Each season of&nbsp;QB1&nbsp;features&nbsp;three main casts from among the American high-school football scene. For the first season, the leads were Jame Fromm (Georgia), Tate Martell (Ohio State and Miami), and Tayvon Bowers (Wake Forest). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The second season saw Justin Fields (Georgia and Ohio State), Sam Hartman (Wake Forest), and Re-al Mitchell (Iowa State).</p><p>Like the first and second seasons, the third season also cast star quarterbacks of the high-school football scene. It featured Lance LeGendre (Maryland), Spencer Rattler (Oklahoma), and Nik Scalzo (Kentucky).</p><p>As for the cast of the fourth season, it hasn’t been confirmed yet. And while there have been no official announcements regarding the new leads, some reports have named a few likely candidates. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to&nbsp;Saturday Blitz, the three quarterbacks for&nbsp;QB1&nbsp;season 4 are Alabama’s Bryce Young, Florida’s Anthony Richardson, and Georgia’s Carson Beck.</p><h2>Storyline And Format</h2><p>QB1’s format has remained the same throughout all three seasons. Hence, it is likely that the fourth season will also follow a similar format.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the previous seasons, the story focused on the hardships the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quarterbacks</a>&nbsp;had to face to meet the expectations placed on an elite athlete. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The viewers were further pulled into the story when the leads’ dreams and struggles were presented in a down-to-earth manner.</p><p>The heated nature of the games further elevates the atmosphere of the show, enhancing the viewing experience. Additionally, the way director Berg has portrayed the significant stakes for these quarterbacks who have dedicated so much of their life to football adds a sense of gravitas to the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6avcnnNnqufpJmterOxy56YrJ1dma61sY2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
