His passion and leadership won him five Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference Coach of the Year awards.</p><p>Lundy’s contributions to the sport of golf went well beyond awards and wins. He was well-known for teaching his pupils essential life lessons and instilling in them the principles of compassion, achieving their best, and living without regrets. These characteristics, as well as his generosity, fairness, sense of humor, and unbounded optimism, formed the foundation of his coaching philosophy.&nbsp;Franklin College President Kerry Prather praised Roger, describing him as a cherished and respected colleague who was always happy to encourage colleagues and coaches and offer his expertise and experience.</p><p>Lance Marshall, the athletic director, reiterated this opinion, stating that Lundy’s teaching stretched well beyond the golf field, leaving an enduring imprint on those he taught.&nbsp;The success and happiness of his student-athletes long after their college careers ended was perhaps Roger Lundy’s greatest source of pride.&nbsp;Their steadfast devotion and affection for him demonstrated the significant impact he had on their lives.</p><h2>Roger Lundy’s Cause of Death</h2><p><strong>Roger Lundy</strong>, a well-known person in the golfing world, died unexpectedly as a result of complications from sepsis and pneumonia.
