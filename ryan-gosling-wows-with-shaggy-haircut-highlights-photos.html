His often coiffed tresses were cut in a shaggier style with beachy blond bangs skimming his forehead. Warm highlights gave his hair dimension with a sun-kissed glow.</p><p>The Canada native is a longtime ambassador of the luxury Swiss watch brand, along with <a href=#><strong>Patrick Dempsey</strong></a>, who also attended Thursday’s glitzy soirée. Partygoers were lucky enough to view the premiere of a short film starring Gosling and <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> alum<a href=#><strong> Vanessa Bayer</strong></a> titled The Chase for Carrera. The campaign shows <a href=#>the Gray Man actor</a> attempting to steal the new Tag Heuer Carrera Glassbox from a film set — and being chased by Bayer as he drives away in a Porsche.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ryan-Gosling-New-Shaggy-Hairstyle-inline.jpg><p>Fans of the La La Land star have been <a href=#>raving over his transformation</a> as he prepares to play Ken in the upcoming Barbie movie directed by <a href=#><strong>Greta Gerwig</strong></a>. The first glimpse of Gosling’s playful look was released in June 2022, showing a spray-tanned and chiseled Gosling <a href=#>rocking a bleached ‘do</a> and double denim.</p><p>In the promo pics, Gosling sported <a href=#>a pair of Calvin Klein-inspired briefs</a> with the name “Ken” on the waistband — and his partner, <a href=#><strong>Eva Mendes</strong></a>, quickly tried to swipe them for her own collection.</p><p>“I said, ‘Can I please have that underwear? Please! I never ask for anything,'” she teased during an appearance on The Talk in June 2022. “So anyway, I do have it. I’m wearing it right now.”</p><p>Mendes, 49, <a href=#>could hardly contain her excitement</a> the first time she saw Gosling in full character. “Well, first of all, I saw the photo and the 14-year-old in me was like, ‘Ahhh,'” she said. “It’s a funny photo and he’s trying to be funny. So, it worked on all levels.”</p><p>The Place Beyond the Pines costars have been going strong <a href=#>since sparking their romance</a> in 2011. Gosling and the Hitch actress share daughters Esmeralda, 8, and Amada, 6.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href=#>Mendes explained</a> to her social media followers why she and the Notebook actor rarely join each other on the red carpet. When a fan gushed that they <a href=#>hoped to see Mendes by Gosling’s side</a> during Barbie promo, she replied via Instagram, “What a cool comment, thank you. But we don’t do those things together. Like these photos I’ve been posting, I’m only comfortable posting because it’s already out there. ♥️.”</p><p>She clarified that she and Gosling “value” their “very private life,” adding, “I’m still dying to do another movie with him though.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6fGorqMoKaspJmjtG7DzrCqZq%2BZqbVuv8eanqCxXZ2uqr7CrqtmoJmcta21xqGrrGWgnby1u9Jo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
