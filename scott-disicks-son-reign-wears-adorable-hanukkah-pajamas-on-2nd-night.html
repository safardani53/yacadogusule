Reign, for his part, held up a toy NERF blaster while wearing adorable holiday pajamas. Reign’s PJs had illustrated items that <a href=#>relate to Hanukkah celebrations</a>, including a menorah, a dreidel, a Star of David, a Torah and a wrapped present.</p><p class=p3>Hanukkah, <a href=#>the Jewish Festival of Lights</a>, began at sundown on Thursday, December 7. To celebrate, Disick decked out his home with blue “Happy Hanukkah” balloons and a gold menorah. In a subsequent Friday upload, Disick shared a pic of the candelabra all lit up on the second night.</p><p class=p3>The reality TV star <a href=#>was raised Jewish</a>, which he’s been candid about<a href=#> wanting to pass down</a> to his three children. (Disick shares sons Mason, 13, and Reign and daughter Penelope, 11, with ex <strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Scott-Disicks-Son-Reign-Wears-Cute-Hanukkah-Pajamas-on-2nd-Night-Best-Things-in-Life-Are-Free-2.jpg><p class=p3>“It’s been a really long time since I’ve been to temple, especially by myself,” Disick admitted during a December 2011 episode of<i> Kourtney & Kim Take New York</i>, when he went to visit his childhood synagogue. “I’m a little rusty [with the prayers] but you gotta start somewhere.”</p><p class=p3>He added at the time: “I feel a little uncomfortable. I don’t speak Hebrew, I can’t read Hebrew. I don’t really even know what prayer we’re on. But, being in temple feels great, it really does. Maybe I’m gonna start going to temple more. I think this is actually going to be good for me.”</p><p class=p3>Since Disick reconnected with his roots after becoming a parent, he’s made sure to <a href=#>mark all the major religious milestones</a>. Disick and his children frequently celebrate the likes of Passover and Hanukkah each year. Mason, for his part, even <a href=#>became a Bar Mitzvah</a> in December 2022.</p><p class=p3>Disick and Kardashian, 44, came together to celebrate their eldest son’s Bar Mitzvah during a blowout bash at Los Angeles’ Offsunset Lounge.</p><p class=p3>“Mazel Tov Mason!!!” the teen’s aunt <strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong> wrote via Instagram at the time, sharing pics with daughter True, 5, and her nieces inside the venue.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>The Kardashian-Jenner clan toasted Mason’s achievement with Raising Canes’ chicken fingers, Van Leeuwen ice cream and churros at the silver-themed party.</p><p class=p3>Disick and Kourtney have continued to coparent Mason, Penelope and Reign as they’ve each moved on for good from their on-and-off relationship. Kourtney, for her part, married <strong>Travis Barker</strong> in 2022. Their first baby together, son Rocky Thirteen, arrived in November. (Barker, 47, is a father of three older children.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasm5%2BpwW6wyKygnKOjYsCwuoyrnKKfnmLEpq3RrGSanJ%2BnrqO4xGafmqaloLiitIypmKOZnZbAbrvNZmmnnF2jtqi002g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
