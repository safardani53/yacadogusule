Reza was mad because he felt like he was trying to give her every opportunity to tell the truth, but she was not having it.&nbsp;</p><p>MJ then chimed in and said that she was mad because her reaction was made out to be an overreaction and that she reacted the way any good friend would have.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/asa-soltan-rahmati-683x1024.jpg><p>Things took a crazy turn after lunch when Golnesa took what seemed to be a panic attack. She revealed that she was light-headed and that she felt she was going to faint.&nbsp;</p><p>Andy asked why Golnesa was still drinking despite going to rehab. She defended herself by saying that she never claimed to be sober. The talk turned to her relationship with Shalom, and all seemed to be right between them.&nbsp;</p><p>Reza then said that she was talking crap because she was stabbing herself where the tattoo of Shalom is. Golnesa&nbsp;claimed that the reason they had the falling out was that she learned he was married before her and felt like he was only looking for a green card.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/10/asa-soltan-on-shahs-of-sunset-860x1024.png><p>When Shalom hit up the stage, it became clear that things were not right between the couple. Shalom noted that they were trying to fix their relationship, but it does not seem like it will be successful.&nbsp;</p><p>Reza then shocked Adam by saying that they could be in an open relationship ten years from now, and the poor man looked like he wanted to run off the set and away from his husband.&nbsp;</p><p>The plan for the baby is that Adam is going to be the biological father and surrogate the child through surrogacy.
