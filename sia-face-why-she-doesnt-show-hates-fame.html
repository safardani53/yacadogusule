Yes, it has everything to do with hating fame.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“If anyone besides famous people knew what it was like to be a famous person, they would never want to be famous,” Sia&nbsp;wrote. “Imagine the stereotypical highly opinionated, completely uninformed mother-in-law character and apply it to every teenager with a computer in the entire world. Then add in all bored people, as well as people whose job it is to report on celebrities. Then, picture that creature, that force, criticizing you for an hour straight once a day, every day, day after day.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sia readdressed the topic&nbsp;after dropping&nbsp;the music video for “Chandelier”, which stars 12-year-old&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Maddie Ziegler.</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I don’t want to be famous, or recognizable,” she told <strong>Chris Connelly</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Nightline&nbsp;in June 2014. “I don’t want to be critiqued about the way that I look on the internet. I’ve been writing pop songs for pop stars now for a couple of years and I’ve become friends with them and see what their life is like and that’s not something I want.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sia has been on the music scene since the late 90s, but as&nbsp;she continues to grow more famous and co-write hit songs, she continues to cover up. While promoting “Chandelier” she repeatedly used&nbsp;Dance Moms&nbsp;star Maddie during performances, along with other celebs, such as&nbsp;<strong>Lena Dunham.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Whether she shows her face or not, Sia’s&nbsp;got incredible talent that definitely does not go unnoticed. But she does&nbsp;show her face&nbsp;sometimes!</p><h3>Sia At The 2015 Grammys</h3><p id=content-paragraph-9>The Grammy nominated artist showed up on the red carpet wearing a huge, shaggy platinum wig, which of course covered everything but her nose and mouth.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>She performed&nbsp;“Chandelier” live, while standing in a corner facing the wall. Meanwhile, the performance was brought to life with&nbsp;Maddie and a surprise appearance from comedian&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kristen Wiig</strong></a>, 41, who shocked all with her incredible, expressive performance. Sia, with Maddie dancing, performed an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazing rendition of “Cheap Thrills”</a> on The Voice finale in May 2016.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>What do YOU think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
