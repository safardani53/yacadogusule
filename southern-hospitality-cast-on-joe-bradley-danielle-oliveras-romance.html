According to his castmates, the relationship has grown quickly in the last month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Southern-Hospitality-Cast-React-to-Joe-Bradley-and-Danielle-Olivera-s-Romance-2.jpg><p>“She’s actually here this weekend, and I got some drinks with them Saturday night. They seem good,” <strong>TJ Dinch</strong> exclusively told Us on Monday in a joint interview with Emmy, 25, and her boyfriend, <strong>Will Kulp</strong>. “They kind of click.”</p><p>Will hasn’t seen Joe and Danielle together just yet, so he told Us, “My jury is still out on them.” However, Will added, “It would be nice to see Joe finally happy,” noting that the VIP manager is “constantly searching.”</p><p>Last season on Southern Hospitality, it became clear that Joe was looking for love in all the wrong places. Viewers saw Joe lose two girls on season 1 after he <a href=#>kissed <strong>Mia Alario</strong></a> and then confessed to friend <strong>Maddi Reese</strong> that he “had feelings” for her on the same day.</p><p>When season 2 began filming this past summer, Joe was on good terms with Maddi, 26, and Mia, 25, forgave him for pursuing them both. Maddi exclusively told Us on Monday that she is now rooting for Joe to find someone new.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Southern-Hospitality-Cast-React-to-Joe-Bradley-and-Danielle-Olivera-s-Romance-3.jpg><p>“Danielle was in Charleston this past weekend, which was really cool. She was super nice, but [she was] also loving Charleston, so that was really fun,” Maddi explained. “I feel like we get to go to New York all the time, but we rarely see people down here. So that was really fun and exciting.”</p><p>While Maddi enjoyed spending time with Danielle, she told Us that “it’s too early to tell or say anything” about her relationship with Joe. Maddi noted that Danielle is a “lovely person.”</p><p>Joe wasn’t the only one coming off romance drama when he and Danielle got together last month. Danielle confirmed in February that she and <strong>Robert Sieber</strong> <a href=#>called it quits</a>&nbsp;over the 2022 holidays after two years together.</p><p>Danielle was fresh off her breakup when she filmed <a href=#>season 3 of Winter House</a> in March and proceeded to hook up with <a href=#>costar <strong>Alex Propson</strong></a>. However, when both Danielle and Joe arrived in Las Vegas in November for BravoCon, they were single and ready to mingle.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Southern Hospitality premieres on Bravo Thursday, December 7, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqoraSdsrO6jKGmrKiZqa6ttdOyZJyZo6l6sLqMo6aeZZKnrqW4xLJknZmenrKtuMRmpqWhppq%2For%2BMq6ammZ6YsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
