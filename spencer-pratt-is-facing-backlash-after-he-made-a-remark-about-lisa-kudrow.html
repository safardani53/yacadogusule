The TV celebrity walked to the stage to answer a fan question, which read:</p><p>“Spence! Tell us about the rudest celebrity you’ve ever encountered.”</p><p>The Hills star responded, saying:</p><p>“Oh, that’s simple. ‘Friends’ character Phoebe. Without a doubt, one of the worst people I’ve ever met. By far.”</p><p>The remark went viral online, disappointing many Kudrow admirers. Many others turned to social media to criticize Pratt’s viewpoint, claiming that the Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion actor was completely oblivious of his presence. Meanwhile, Bravo star Bethenny Frankel backed Pratt’s assessment of Lisa Kudrow in the video’s comments section. She stated:</p><p>“That’s insane. She appeared on my talk program, and I had a bizarre encounter as well.”</p><p>Although Pratt and Frankel did not expand on their reasons for criticizing Kudrow, the former said that if his video received more than one million views, he might consider revealing the story that led to his controversial stance.</p><p>“If this gets a million or more views, I’ll consider recounting the narrative.”</p><p>Frankel was embroiled in an online dispute earlier this week after criticizing the Kardashian-Jenner family’s “destructive” usage of Photoshop in their social media photos.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Spencer-Pratt-1.jpg alt="Spencer Pratt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Spencer Pratt’s remarks on Lisa Kudrow spark a backlash on Twitter.</h2><p>Lisa Kudrow has been one of Hollywood’s most adored stars since her performance as Phoebe Buffay in the classic American comedy Friends garnered her worldwide acclaim.
