People born in the year of the ox are dedicated workers who take their responsibilities seriously. Even if they encounter difficulties at work, they will continue. They aren't very romantic, but they are patient and would never impose themselves on someone they didn't like. They are normally silent and keep their emotions hidden. Others find it difficult to understand them. When they lose their cool, it's like an explosion that scares people away.</p><p>People born on October 4 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Libra</strong>. Libra energy is defined by balance, harmony, and fairness. Libra, as a cardinal air sign, is symbolized by the scales (interestingly, the sole inanimate item in the zodiac), a relationship that symbolizes Libra's obsession with achieving equilibrium. Libra is preoccupied with symmetry and tries to find balance in all aspects of life, especially in matters of the heart.</p><p>Notable for his work on the DGA Award-winning movie Paris Trout (1991), he is also famous as the director of the Golden Globe and Emmy-nominated Family of Spies (1990).
