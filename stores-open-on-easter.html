Most locations are open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., but as with all of these listings, you might want to call them up ahead of time, just to be safe. Also, keep in mind that many stores are still doing curbside pickup or even delivery — talk about convenient!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Apple</h2><p>Did your dongle stop working just before you tried to screen The Passion of the Christ for your Easter party? Worry not! Although it varies by location, your local Apple store may be open on Easter Sunday. Be sure to check online before heading out, though!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bass Pro Shops</h2><p>Need some supplies for your Easter Sunday fishing trip?
