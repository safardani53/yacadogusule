With her debut single "Tim McGraw" hitting a very respectable No. 6 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, the singer (then just 16 years old) rocked a truly country get-up at the Academy of Country Music Awards: a floral-patterned halter dress and cowboy boots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I used to stand back there and be waiting in the lines to get autographs, so it's completely surreal," she told Country Weekly months before the release of her debut album <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Taylor Swift</a>. "Although, it has been a long time waiting for this and working for this and trying so hard to get here, it feels amazing to be sitting here."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nominated for best new artist at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift was perhaps foreshadowing her Fearless era (her iconic song "Love Story" changed not only her life, but amassed a legion of Swifties) with her princess-pink KaufmanFranco dress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is my first VMAs, and just being on the red carpet is so overwhelming and amazing," she said on the red carpet. "I'm not gonna win! It's just cool to be here."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jason Kempin/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's been 10 years since Swift's Fearless tour (here she is on stage at Madison Square Garden) and much has changed. One thing that hasn't? Swift's love for glitter and sparkle.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dan MacMedan/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two years later, Swift showed off a more sophisticated look at the 2010 Grammys with a form-fitting sparkly blue gown.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Making her way up to the stage, the singer was in total shock as she accepted her award for album of the year. "Oh wow, thank you so much. I just hope that you know how much this means to me," she said. "Our families are freaking out in their living rooms. My dad and my little brother are losing their minds in the living room right now. This is for my dad. Thank you for all those times that you said I could do whatever I wanted in life, and my mom, you're my best friend."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that year, she released her third studio album, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Speak Now</a>, which she wrote entirely on her own.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Larry Busacca/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I’m still a little surprised every time we pull into a stadium,” Swift told Rolling Stone while in the middle of her sold-out Speak Now tour in 2012.

Her naturally curly hair had also been straightened and she sported some chic blunt bangs. (She had a similar look on her Red album cover.)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Taylor Swift's Red Tour.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Scott Barbour/TAS/Getty Images for TAS</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There was still plenty of sparkle on Swift's Red tour in 2013, but the singer also put on a new persona: circus ring leader.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Once Taylor created her set list for the tour and the choreography was discussed, the design process was in full effect to incorporate Taylor's ideas," costume and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wardrobe designer Marina Toybina told The Hollywood Reporter</a> at the time.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>James Devaney/GC Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2014, Swift embraced New York as her home base — and adopted the city's all-black uniform. Two days after releasing her first pure pop album <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">1989</a>, the star — who rocked a new lob — sat front and center at a Knicks game in head-to-toe black.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Welcome to New York</a>," indeed!</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Bradley Kanaris/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On her 1989 tour in 2015, Swift continued channeling the glitz and glam of New York City, rocking sunglasses, sparkly track jackets, crop tops and bedazzled (of course!) mini skirts on stage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I really like my life right now,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she told Rolling Stone</a>. “I have friends around me all the time. I’ve started painting more. I’ve been working out a lot. I’ve started to really take pride in being strong. I love the album I made. I love that I moved to New York. So in terms of being happy, I’ve never been closer to that.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gotham/GC Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a very public feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West, Swift chose to go under the radar for months in 2016 and only began emerging before the release of her record-breaking album <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">reputation</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the slithery, snake-filled era, the superstar ditched the girly dresses and opted for edgier pieces, including studded booties, distressed denim and oversized hoodies.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift's curls also made an epic return on her 2018 tour — but gone was the bright red lip from 1989. Instead, the singer often painted her lips a dark, brooding hue. And though some of her tour costumes included pops of color (Tide Pod dress, anyone?), the star's wardrobe on stage included sleek, dark looks that represented the rebellious themes of her sixth studio album.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Taylor Swift.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Matt Baron/REX/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift has shed her snakeskin!
