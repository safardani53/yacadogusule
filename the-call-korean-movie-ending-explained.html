Let us explain how the ending went down.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler Alert: This article contains spoilers for the South Korean Netflix film </strong><strong>The Call</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Although <a href=#>Netflix</a> offers plenty of great English language content, some subscribers have also explored the array of foreign titles that are now available on the service. One of those titles, a Korean movie called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Call</a>, comes packed with a shocking ending that has left fans of the movie bewildered. Now, some of them are wondering exactly what that ending means for the film as a whole.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is 'The Call' about?</h2><p>The Call tells the story of two women who find that they can communicate with one another through time via an old cordless phone in a house that they both, at one point in time, lived in. The woman living in 2019 is named Seo-yeon (Park Shin-Hye), and the woman she's conversing with is named Young-sook (Jong-seo Jun), who lives in 1999. Through their communication, the two women are able to help prevent terrible tragedies from occurring in one another's lives.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Young-sook prevents a fire that killed Seo-yeon's father, and Seo-yeon returns the favor by warning Young-sook that her mother is going to kill her during an exorcism. When Young-sook turns the tables on her mother and kills her, her path is changed forever. Instead of dying, Young-sook becomes a serial killer, and people in Seo-yeon's present begin to disappear as she murders them.&nbsp;</p><p>Young-sook eventually kills Seo-yeon's father in 1999, and takes an 8-year-old Seo-yeon captive. These events in 1999 change Seo-yeon's present yet again. Young-sook eventually convinces Seo-yeon to find out how Young-sook will be arrested so that she can avoid capture, and then the two confront one another in the present day, where Young-sook is older but has continued killing people.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'The Call' seems to end on a happy note.</h2><p>The film ends with Seo-yeon talking to her mother in 1999 through the phone. Her mother, Eun-ae (Sung-ryung Kim), is being chased by Young-sook, and Seo-yeon encourages her to fight back. The film appears to end with Seo-yeon's mother sacrificing herself in order to kill Young-sook, effectively erasing her from the 2019 timeline. The movie's final moments reveal that Eun-ae is actually alive in 2019, and she is reunited with her daughter in the closing scene.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Although this ending seems to be happy, a mid-credits scene completely changes our feelings about the film. In that scene, we see that 2019 Young-sook has used the phone to call her younger counterpart. In doing so, Young-sook is able to warn her younger self about Eun-ae's attack and successfully avoid it, killing Eun-ae in the process and erasing her from 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, the scene cuts to a room where a person in a white cloth is tied to a chair and screaming for help. Viewers see the cloth get removed, and discover that Seo-yeon has been imprisoned, presumably by Young-sook. The movie ends here, on a note suggesting that in The Call, Young-sook will wind up taking Seo-yeon as her next victim.&nbsp;</p><p>That dark, depressing ending only gets darker when you realize that Seo-yeon is the only one who knows about the phone and would therefore be unable to change the future yet again. If she dies, Young-sook's future as a successful serial killer is set in stone, and there's nothing that anyone can do to change it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecKao6Vlm6S%2Fpq3NZqSorpmaeqa6w6KloGWVrb2trcinnJ0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
