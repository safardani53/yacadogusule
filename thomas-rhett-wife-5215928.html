Early in his career, he penned hits for other country stars like&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jason Aldean</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;Florida Georgia Line, but he made his debut in 2012, and released his first record&nbsp;It Goes Like This&nbsp;in 2013.

The “Get Some of That” singer and the woman he’d eventually marry were actually childhood friends. They first met when they were in sixth grade and had a short romance when they were in high school, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;“I don’t think she really noticed me ’til we were 16,” Thomas joked in a radio interview, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Boot.&nbsp;</a></p><h2>They’ve Been Married Since 2012</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Even though their high school romance didn’t work out, the pair later reunited, but they almost went down very different paths. Thomas admitted that she was seeing someone else when he came forward with his feelings as an adult in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS This Morning&nbsp;</a>in 2016. “Her dad called me and said, ‘If you don’t come over here tonight and tell Lauren how you feel about her, then I’m going to tell her how you feel about her.’ So I was like, ‘Well that would be so weird,'” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Thomas revealed that he popped the question while they were at the Nashville restaurant Giovanni’s, and he wrote “Marry Me?” on a bottle of wine, and of course, she said yes. The pair got married in Nashville in October 2012, and they’ve been living happily ever after ever since.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>When the pair celebrated their 11th <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>anniversary together,</a> Thomas wrote a loving tribute to her on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, recalling their long history. “11 years married to this amazing woman. I can still remember what she looked like in first grade. I still remember how much taller than me she was at church camp in 6th grade. I still remember picking her up on our first date at 16. I still remember how fast my heart was beating when she walked down the aisle. Basically I remember it all so vividly. I can’t believe how much life we have gotten to share together,” he wrote.</p><h2>She’s an Author and Podcast Host</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>While her husband is a chart-topping country music star, Lauren has plenty of projects of her own. She released her debut memoir&nbsp;Live in Love: Growing Together Through Life’s Changes&nbsp;in August 2020, and it’s a&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;Bestseller. In addition to the book, she also hosts the podcast&nbsp;Live in Love.&nbsp;</p><h2>They Have Four Daughters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/thomas-rhett-wife-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Thomas and Lauren are also loving parents to<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> four girls</a>. They adopted their oldest daughter&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Willa Gray</a>,&nbsp;</strong>8, in 2015. Since then, they’ve also had three more girls:&nbsp;<strong>Ada James,&nbsp;</strong>6,&nbsp;<strong>Lauren Love,&nbsp;</strong>3, and&nbsp;<strong>Lillie Carolina,&nbsp;</strong>2. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Their kids</a> have also accompanied them to red-carpet events and been featured on their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media</a> over the years.</p><h2>She Previously Worked for a Non-Profit</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Before beginning her work on her book and podcast, Lauren was involved with the charitable organization 147 Million Orphans. While she doesn’t work there anymore, she’s maintained the connection, and she and Thomas still raise money for them. The couple has hosted benefits for the organization, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OhpqaZo2K%2FqbHTrWSwoZaaenZ%2BkG5wa3Bf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
