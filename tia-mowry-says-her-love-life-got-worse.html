In the video, she applied lip gloss in the mirror while mouthing, “So what do you do for work?” and “How many siblings do you have? Ugh.”</p><p>Mowry shed light about her thoughts on dating in her caption: “Fun Fact: I’ve never been on the dating scene my entire life. So when I tell you I’m nervous and terrified of doing <a href=#>this whole dating thing</a>, I mean it.”</p><p>She continued: “Even though I’m <a href=#>in my 40’s,</a> I feel so inexperienced! And while it would be easy to just throw in the towel and avoid the potential for awkwardness and hurt, I know God’s got me! So if you’re feeling apprehensive about new experiences, just know you got this, and we’re in this together!”</p><p>Mowry and Hardrict share son <a href=#>Cree,</a> 12, and daughter Cairo, 5. In June, she opened up to <a href=# rel=noopener>HelloBeautiful </a>about how the divorce was a “gift” for her children.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“A part of my decision was also for them,” she explained. “For them seeing their mother walk in truth, I feel like it’s a great lesson for them because it was not an easy decision.”</p><p>Mowry said that although her divorce was<a href=#> “one of the hardest decisions”</a> she’s ever made, her kids will be able to “see that mommy can do it, that mommy, no matter what people say, no matter, even if there’s some sort of doubt, whatever, mommy pushed through.” She continued, “[They can say] my mommy is living and chasing her truth. I want my children to do that. That’s the best gift I can give them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZFiurDD0bJkrJmpqHqpsdFmo6iulWK5qrLEZp6orF2svLO%2FxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
