Los Blancos have fallen short of the lofty expectations that have surrounded one of the greatest clubs in the world.</p><p>Los Blancos are second in La Liga with 27 points after 12 league games under Carlo Ancelotti’s management. With nine points from four games, they lead their group in the UEFA Champions League.</p><p>Although Real Madrid has been entertaining on the field this season, they have also suffered some shocking defeats. One of the most significant was the 2-1 defeat at home to Sheriff Tiraspol in the Champions League. Some players have clearly underperformed, while others are clearly not in Ancelotti’s plans.</p><p>It goes without saying that the Madrid squad is riddled with ineptitude. With Florentino Perez desperate for reinforcements and Galactico signings, Madrid will be forced to sell some of their stars during the upcoming transfer window.</p><h2>Number 5: Ceballos</h2><p><strong>Dani Ceballos</strong> was one of the Spanish teenagers heralded as the “next big thing.” Unfortunately, he has fallen short of expectations and has cut a despondent figure at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ceballos.jpeg><p>After his breakout season with Real Betis, Ceballos caught the attention of scouts. However, the 25-year-old never found his way into Real Madrid’s starting lineup, failing to impress former manager Zinedine Zidane. As a result, he was loaned out to Arsenal in 2019, but even that did not help the player.</p><p>Ceballos had a disappointing loan spell with the Gunners, scoring two goals and providing five assists in 77 appearances. The midfielder has failed to impress Ancelotti since his loan return and is clearly not in the coach’s plans.</p><h2>Number 4: Jesus Vallejo</h2><p>Real Madrid’s starting lineup does not include <strong>Jesus Vallejo.</strong> The 24-year-old has failed to impress or cement his place in any of his loan spells, and the same can be said for the Spanish giants. There are strong indications that he will not be returning to Santiago Bernabeu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jesus-Vallejo.jpg><p>Vallejo returned to Real Madrid in the summer after a quiet loan spell at Granada. Since then, the center-back has only made one appearance, with Ancelotti making it clear that Vallejo will not be getting many minutes under him. Ancelotti prefers David Alaba, Nacho, or even Ferland Mendy in the center of defense over him.</p><p>Staying with the La Liga giants is clearly not an option for Vallejo, and Los Blancos would be better off parting ways with the player.</p><h2>Number 3: Luka Jovic</h2><p>Following <strong>Luka Jovic’</strong>s breakout season at Eintracht Frankfurt, Real Madrid paid a high price (€60 million) to sign the striker for the 2019 season. Unfortunately, Jovic has struggled to find his footing and seize the few opportunities that have presented themselves to him in the Spanish capital since then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Luka-Jovic-1.jpg><p>Jovic has struggled to find his rhythm early in his career, despite his stature and worth. Since joining Real Madrid in 2019, the 23-year-old has only scored twice. He has failed to cement his place in the squad as a result of his poor performances. Jovic’s life has been made more difficult by the fact that Karim Benzema has been in top form.</p><p>Given that Jovic was one of the most expensive signings in Real Madrid history, his move has been a complete flop. His market value has dropped, despite the fact that he is one of the club’s highest-paid employees. Los Blancos fans will be eager to get rid of the Serbian sharpshooter as soon as possible.</p><h2>Number 2: Gareth Bale</h2><p>During his time at Real Madrid, <strong>Gareth Bale</strong> has helped the club win a number of trophies. Among these are the Copa del Rey in 2013 and the Champions League in 2018. Nonetheless, the Welshman’s final few years at the club have left a sour taste in their mouth.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gareth-Bale-1.jpg alt width=650 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Following Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure, Bale was expected to take over in goal, but that has not been the case since.</p><p>Bale hasn’t had much of an impact on the team since 2018 and hasn’t even been a starter. Last season, the Welsh winger was loaned out to his former club Tottenham Hotspur due to his poor form and consistent injuries. Bale has only played three league games since returning from loan, before suffering another injury.</p><p>Bale’s contract is set to expire in the summer of 2022, and there has been no talk of extending it. It would still be preferable for Los Blancos to offload him in January in order to obtain a low fee for the player.</p><h2>Number 1: Eden Hazard</h2><p><strong>Eden Hazard</strong>‘s career has only deteriorated since joining Real Madrid in 2019. The Belgian arrived as a ‘Galactico’ signing, but injuries have marred his tenure, and he now finds himself at the bottom of the pecking order in the Spanish capital.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Eden-Hazard-5.jpg alt width=650 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The Spanish press chastised hazard during his early days at Real Madrid for being ‘overweight.’ The winger’s poor performance only added to his misery before he suffered a devastating injury. The injury has reoccurred, and the 30-year-old has not been the same.</p><p>Hazard has only scored five goals during his time at Real Madrid. Real Madrid would be wise to offload the Belgian and save a significant wage bill.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanqxuMCynKurXaeyoriMppidqpmZerS0zq6jnWWjmrmtecinZK2glWK3orrUmqmyZaSnrq%2B%2FxZ6pZq%2BZo7Gww44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
