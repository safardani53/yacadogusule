The couple reportedly began dating in 2015 and were together for three years.</p><p>Jordyn confirmed the split herself during an Instagram Live session in 2019 (via the Parade report). She revealed to a fan who had asked if she loved Noah that, "Of course I love him. I love him so much but you guys should know we broke up this past summer but yeah I love him."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Now that Trevor Noah is no longer hosting The Daily Show, he might have more time to settle down with someone if that's what he'd like to do, but he's by no means taking a break from his career.
