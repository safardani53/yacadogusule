The usual black hot-air balloons and grunts lurking around have disappeared, leaving many players confused — especially those working to defeat some of the Team GO Rocket leaders.</p><p>This has baffled many players, as defeating the grunts stationed at stops and in hot-air balloons was an integral part of gameplay, offering some valuable rewards for battles won.

In a statement on Twitter, the company revealed that all Team GO Rocket encounters would be unavailable for the time being.</p><p>"Trainers, while we investigate errors associated with Team GO Rocket encounters, they will be temporarily unavailable," the tweet read. "We'll update here with more information. We apologize for any inconvenience."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This means that for the moment, players won't be able to find the Team GO Rocket balloons once every six hours or find grunts at their local Poké Stops. Rocket Radars will also not work at the moment, since none of the Team GO Rocket grunts will be available for battle until further notice.</p><p>Many players reportedly found that during encounters with the balloons and grunts, their game would freeze, forcing many to come up with workarounds that were not readily known to most players.</p><p>As of this writing, Niantic has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">removed the previous announcement</a> stating that there would be an increase in Team GO Rocket appearances during Rivals week. It does not appear like there are any other opportunities being substituted in place of Team GO Rocket right now. In the meantime, players will have to pursue some of the other challenges and activities while waiting for more news.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Trainers, while we investigate errors associated with Team GO Rocket encounters, they will be temporarily unavailable.

This is especially frustrating to players who were trying valiantly to beat leaders like <a href=#>Giovanni</a>. Considering the effort trainers had to put in to be able to locate Giovanni for a chance to go head to head with him, this temporary pause on Team GO Rocket can be frustrating.</p><p>While we wait for an announcement regarding when Team GO Rocket will return to the game, it's not likely that it will remain inactive for long. The villainous group is closely woven into the gameplay, and part of trainers' objective has been to take Team GO Rocket down.</p><p>Niantic has promised to update players on its Twitter account when the issue has been resolved, so it's best to start there. The bug fix will likely come in a new update, so be on the lookout for that, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTnpimZaKksKyx02anqKOVoryvecao</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
