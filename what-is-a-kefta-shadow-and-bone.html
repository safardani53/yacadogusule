The fictional "kefta" is typically made of wool and a material called "Grisha steel" so they are bulletproof. In real life, a kaftan can be made of wool, cashmere, silk, or cotton.</p><p>In the Grishaverse, which includes Leigh's book series and the television show Shadow and Bone, the color of a Grisha's kefta signifies to <a href=#>which "order" a Grisha</a> belongs. Non-Grisha characters do not wear keftas. Servants in the Little Palace, <a href=#>like Genya during Season 1</a>, are forced to wear keftas of white to indicate their low position.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The three Grisha "orders" wear base-colored keftas of red, blue, and purple. Red for Corporalnik, blue for Etherealki, and purple for Materialki. Corporalnik is the "top" order and has powers based around the body, while Etherealki has powers based in nature and Materialki has powers based around chemicals or metals.</p><p>General Kirigan/The Darkling and Alina Starkov/The Sun Summoner are technically Etherealki but prefer to wear black and gold as a symbol of their unique abilities.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">You can buy a kefta of your own at Hot Topic.</h2><p>For anyone who spent two seasons admiring the handiwork of costume designer Wendy Partridge, who is responsible for bringing the gorgeous keftas from page to screen, you can now get a simplified version for your own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at Hot Topic</a>!
