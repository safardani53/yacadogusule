The track begins by painting a picture of Swift, exhausted from fighting for a difficult relationship.</p><p>“My knuckles were bruised like violets / Sucker-punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked / Spineless in my tomb of silence / Tore your banners down, took the battle underground / And maybe it was egos swinging / Maybe it was her / Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, when we reach the chorus, it becomes clear that despite the (hypothetical) violence and hardship endured throughout the relationship, it would be worth it if they could reach the other side. As the song continues, the subject of trust (or lack thereof), becomes a key factor.</p><p>Swift is haunted by past relationships and projecting her insecurities onto her partner, which she points out when she sings:</p><p>“And maybe it's the past that's talking / Screaming from a crypt / Telling me to punish you for things you never did / So I justified it.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The relationship comes to a head at the song’s bridge. Swift nearly loses her love forever, comparing her worn-down partner to a "broken and blue" soldier. When she realizes the toll her actions have taken, she calls off her “troops” and the war between them is over.</p><p>“The Great War” ends on a hopeful note. After countless battles, Swift has waved the white flag and is ready to make peace. Now that the worst is over, she suggests the fighting only made them stronger, and now they can move forward — together.</p><p>“I vowed I would always be yours / 'Cause we survived the Great War.”</p><p>Listen to Swift’s 10th studio album "Midnights," out now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmasmJp6qL7Emqtmr5GneqKuzq6rZqyRrrmwvoysrqKepA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
