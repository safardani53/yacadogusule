Former teammate <strong>Derek Wolfe</strong> reportedly told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>104.3 The Fan</a> on Tuesday, Dec 21, that it’s “not looking good.” “He has pneumonia and I’m putting it out there just to send positive vibes his way,” Derek said of his pal, adding that he is an “an all-around great dude.” Orlando in particular seemed to be distressed, tweeting several times on Dec 20. “Lord please have mercy, please,” he wrote.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#BroncosCountry</a> please pray for Ronnie Hillman he’s in hospice and not doing well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>— Orlando Franklin (@OFranklin74) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 20, 2022</a></p><h2>3.

He’s currently in hospice and being kept “out of pain.” “Though <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>this message</a> is difficult to share, we feel it is necessary,” they wrote. “August of this year, Ronnie was diagnosed with Renal Medullary Carcinoma.
